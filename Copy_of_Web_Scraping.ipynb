            "Consider taking a trip to a Spanish speaking country.\n",
            "Once you feel comfortable with the basics of Spanish speech, consider taking a trip a Spanish speaking country. There's no better way to immerse yourself in a language than to hang-out and chat with the locals![15]Be aware that every Spanish-speaking country has a different accent, different slang, and sometimes even different vocabulary.  For example, Chilean Spanish is extremely different from Mexican Spanish, from the Spanish of Spain, and even Argentine Spanish.In fact, as you advance in your Spanish proficiency, you may find it helpful to focus on one particular flavor of Spanish. It could be confusing if your lessons continually shift among word meanings and pronunciations for each country. However only about 2% of Spanish vocabulary is different in each country. You must concentrate on the remaining 98%.\n",
            "Don't be discouraged!\n",
            "If you're serious about learning to speak Spanish, keep at it - the satisfaction you'll get from mastering a second language will far outweigh the difficulties you encounter along the way. Learning a new language takes time and practice, it won't happen overnight. If you still need some extra motivation, here are some things that make Spanish easier to learn than other languages:[16]Spanish uses the Subject-Object-Verb word order, just like English. This means that it's easier to translate directly from English to Spanish, without having to worry about rearranging the structure of the sentence.Spanish spelling is very phonetic, so it's usually quite easy to pronounce a word correctly, just by saying it like it's spelled. This is not the case in English, so Spanish learners of English have a much harder time pronouncing words correctly when reading!As mentioned before, about 30% to 40% of words in Spanish have an English cognate. This is because of their shared Latin roots. As a result, you already have an extensive Spanish vocabulary before you even get started - all it needs is a few tweaks and a Spanish twang!\n",

In about half of the states, the judge will consider marital fault, including adultery.You need to find out if your state considers adultery. You should research your state law. Search online for your state, alimony, and adultery.\n",
            "Consult with an attorney.\n",
            "If you cant find out whether your state considers adultery when deciding alimony, you should consult with an attorney. Only a qualified attorney can give you accurate legal advice about your state law.You can get a referral to a divorce attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the attorney and schedule a consultation. Ask how much they charge for a half-hour meeting.You should also consider hiring the lawyer to represent you. Although you can meet for just a half-hour meeting, you might be better off hiring him or her to handle the divorce for you. Ask how much it would cost.\n",

            "Although some states consider adultery when determining alimony, it depends on the circumstances. You should discuss your situation with your lawyer.For example, in Georgia, the adultery must have been the cause of the divorce. It isnt enough that your spouse cheated five years ago but you reconciled. Instead, the infidelity must have ended the marriage.[1]\n",

            "Your state might not allow a judge to consider adultery. However, you can still try to deny your cheating spouse alimony. Generally, judges consider the following financial factors:[2][3]Income disparity. If your income is much higher than your spouses, then a judge is more likely to award alimony. However, if your incomes are similar, you have a strong argument against alimony.Each spouses future earning potential. Your spouse may not be working now. However, he or she could have a college degree and higher earning power if they got a job. A judge will consider how much your ex could make, not how much they do make.Your standard of living during the marriage. If your spouse became accustomed to a high standard of living, then the judge might award alimony. However, if you had a normal middle-class life, then you could argue that alimony isnt appropriate, especially when your spouse can maintain that lifestyle on their own.Whether your spouse stayed home to raise the children. If your spouse didnt forfeit their career for your family, then you can argue alimony isnt necessary.The contribution your spouse made to your career. A spouse who works to put another through school or helps start a business has a stronger claim to alimony. You should point out if your spouse didnt make any kind of contribution to your career.\n",

If your marriage was short, then you can argue that alimony isnt appropriate.Your spouses age. Your spouse is more likely to get alimony the older they are. If your spouse is relatively young, you can argue alimony isnt necessary.Your spouses emotional or physical condition. If your spouse is disabled, then he or she will have a strong argument for alimony. However, if your spouse is healthy, then you can argue alimony isnt necessary.Domestic violence. In California, for example, the judge can lower or eliminate alimony if one spouse has been convicted of domestic violence.[5]\n",
            "Come up with other strategies.\n",
            "You might not be able to prevent alimony, even if your spouse cheated. Nevertheless, you should discuss other potential strategies with your attorney for making sure your spouse gets as few assets as possible.For example, your spouse might have used marital property to support a lover. In this situation, the judge can deduct the money spent on the lover from the amount of marital property your spouse will get in the divorce.[6]\n",
            "Consider suing your spouse for a sexually-transmitted disease.\n",
            "If your spouse pick up an STD during an affair, then you might be able to sue him or her for personal injury if the STD was transmitted to you.[7] You should talk about this option with your lawyer.\n",

            "You need proof that your spouse has been unfaithful.[8] Although you can tell the judge your suspicions, nothing is more powerful than evidence. In particular, you should try to get your spouse to admit to being unfaithful.If your spouse admits to cheating, you should write down the day and time of the admission. Because your spouse might try to walk back the admission, you should look for other evidence.Keep communications. Your ex might slip up and admit to adultery in an email or letter. You should hold onto these communications. You can introduce them into court as evidence.\n",
            "Talk to the alleged partner.\n",
            "You can also get evidence of adultery by talking to the person your spouse slept with. He or she might confirm that they slept with your spouse during your marriage. A partner is probably more likely to admit this if their relationship with your spouse has ended.\n",
            "Obtain other evidence.\n",
            "You dont have to videotape your spouse in the act with someone else. However, you need to prove that he or she had the motive and the opportunity to cheat on you. You can prove motive and opportunity by gathering the following:[9]Photos of your spouse and their lover together. It would be ideal if they were acting in an intimate manner in the photographs.Phone records that show constant communication between them. Look for late-night calls or calls on the weekend.Witnesses who saw your spouse and their lover together.Credit card or bank records that show large purchases, hotel visits, etc.\n",

You should think about hiring a private investigator.[11] This person can follow your spouse around and find out who they are spending their time with.Private detectives generally charge $40-100 per hour. They also charge for additional costs, such as mileage.[12]You can find detectives in the phone book. Call one up and discuss the reasons for hiring them. Discuss the scope of the investigation and what kinds of evidence you want them to gather.\n",
            "Complete the divorce paperwork.\n",
            "You should probably be the person to file for divorce. You should pick up the forms required to file for divorce from the court clerk at the family law court in the county where you live. Often, these forms are posted online.Divorce can be fault or no fault. Almost all states have no fault divorce, which means neither party is to blame. However, about two-thirds still allow you to allege fault, such as adultery.[13] If you have the option of alleging fault when you file for divorce, then make sure to select adultery.Some no fault states, such as Florida, still consider adultery when determining alimony.[14] For this reason, even in a no fault state you should try to mention adultery in the divorce petition.Your spouse might have beat you to the courthouse and have filed for divorce first. He or she should ask for alimony in the petition. In this situation, you will be able to answer the divorce petition and explain why your spouse isnt entitled to alimony.[15] Mention the infidelity and all other reasons.\n",

You also have to give your spouse a copy of everything you file in your case.[16] This is called making service.You can generally make service of divorce papers by paying the sheriff or constable to serve them. You cannot serve them yourself.[17]Depending on your court, you can also hire a private process server, which you can find in the phone book. They make service for a small fee.You might also ask someone 18 or older who isnt a party to the case to serve the papers for you.\n",
            "Prepare for the hearing.\n",
            "In a contested divorce, you will need to have a trial or hearing. You will probably have many preliminary status hearings and conferences as you prepare for your hearing/trial. At these, you will appear before the judge and hammer out issues that will allow you to prepare for trial.You may also have a chance for discovery. Discovery is the fact-finding portion of a divorce.[18] In discovery, you can send subpoenas to people requesting documents, such as financial records. You can also have your spouse answer questions under oath. If you werent able to get solid proof of adultery before filing for divorce, then you can use discovery to gather additional, helpful information.\n",
            "Get your witnesses lined up.\n",

            "Present your evidence.\n",
            "You can have witnesses testify and introduce documents to convince the judge that your spouse committed adultery. In many states, you dont actually have to prove that adultery happened. Instead, you need to prove that your spouse had the disposition and opportunity to cheat.To prove disposition, you can introduce evidence that your spouse showed affection publicly with their alleged lover. You can introduce photographs of them kissing, hugging, holding hands, etc. Or you can have witnesses testify that they observed this conduct.To prove opportunity, you should introduce evidence that your spouse was seen entering their lovers apartment late at night and not leaving until the morning. Alternately, you could show that they went away together and stayed in the same hotel.\n",
            "Cross-examine your spouses witnesses.\n",

            "When you or your child has chickenpox, it will likely be accompanied by a fever. To combat fever and reduce any pain, use over the counter fever reducers such as paracetamol or acetaminophen. Read all packaging information before taking any medication. If you are not sure if the medication is safe to take, do not give or take it before talking to a medical professional.Do not give aspirin or aspirin-containing medication to treat fever or other symptoms of the chickenpox. Taking aspirin while you have the chickenpox can cause Reye's syndrome, which affects the liver and brain and can be fatal.[1]Talk to your doctor about ibuprofen use. In rare instances, it can cause adverse skin reactions and secondary infections.[2]\n",
            "Try over the counter antihistamines.\n",
            "The major symptom of chickenpox is intense itching at the site of the pox. There may be times when the itching is unbearable or causes too much discomfort. When this happens, take over the counter antihistamines such as Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin to help relieve the itching. Talk to your doctor about dosing of these medications for children; they may be especially helpful at night when you want to sleep.[3]If you find that you or your child are in severe pain or discomfort, see a medical professional. The doctor might be able to provide a prescription strength antihistamine.[4]\n",
            "Stay hydrated.\n",
            "It is important to stay hydrated while you have the chickenpox. There is a possibility of dehydration while you have the chickenpox. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.[5] Also drink other hydrating liquids, such as sports drinks.Popsicles are a great way to help children stay hydrated if they don't want to drink enough water.[6]\n",
            "Eat soft, gentle foods.\n",
            "Sores may develop on the inside of the mouth when you or your child get the chickenpox. These can be very irritating and cause you pain, especially if you eat the wrong foods. Try soft, gentle foods such as warm soup, oatmeal, pudding, or ice cream. If there are especially painful sores inside the mouth, avoid eating foods that are salty, spicy, acidic, or too hot.[7]You or your child can occasionally suck ice cubes, popsicles, or suckers to ease the pain of sores inside the mouth.[8]\n",
            "Stay home.\n",
            "If you or your child has chickenpox, stay at home or keep them at home as much as possible. Do not go to work or school or let your children who are infected go to school. You do not want to spread the virus to anyone else  chickenpox is easily spread through the air or contact with the rash. Plus, you do not want to make the symptoms worse through overexertion.[9]Once the sores have scabbed over and dried up, the virus is no longer contagious. This generally takes five to seven days.[10]\n",
            "Don't scratch.\n",
            "The most important thing to remember about chickenpox is that you or your child shouldn't scratch the pox. Scratching them will make them worse and cause even more irritation and possible infection. If they are scratched too much, the sores can develop into scars that might remain after the chickenpox has cleared up.[11]This will be hard, but you have to try or make your child try.[12]\n",
            "Cut the fingernails.\n",
            "Although you should avoid scratching or letting your child scratch the sores in general, it is typically difficult to avoid all the time. Since you or your child will likely scratch yourself, keep the fingernails short and filed smooth. This will help prevent the nails from scratching the sores, which can open the skin, prolong the healing process, be more painful, and possibly cause infection.[13]\n",
            "Cover the hands.\n",
            "If you or your child is still scratching with short fingernails, consider covering the hands with gloves or socks. This will help to prevent injury. If you or he attempt to itch with covered hands, there will be minimal irritation and problems because the fingernails will be covered.[14]Even if you or your child are good about not scratching during the day, cover the hands at night because it is possible to scratch the skin while asleep.[15]\n",
            "Dress appropriately.\n",
            "The skin will be sweaty and irritated during the chickenpox. To avoid skin irritation, don't wear tight-fitting clothing. Choose looser, cotton-based clothes that keep the body at a comfortable temperature and that will move softly against the skin. These are best to prevent discomfort.[16]Don't wear harsh fabrics such denim and wool.\n",
            "Stay cool.\n",
            "The skin will get aggravated and hot during the chickenpox, both from the fever and the sores. Stay away from locations that are too hot or humid because this will make you or your child hotter and make the skin itch even more. This means you or your child shouldn't go outside in hot or humid weather and you need to keep your house at a cool temperature.[17]Also avoid activities that will increase body temperature and cause too much sweating.[18]\n",
            "Apply calamine lotion.\n",
            "Calamine lotion is a great remedy for itchy skin and can help heal the sores. Apply it as often as needed if the itchiness and pain are too uncomfortable to handle. The lotion will soothe the skin and provide an element of relief.[19]You can also try other types of skin cooling gel to help with the pox. You can put hydrocortisone cream or ointment on bumps that are especially red, itchy, or inflamed for a few daysDo not use lotion with Benadryl in it. Frequent reapplication can cause toxicity as too much of the medicine is absorbed into your bloodstream.\n",
            "Take a cool bath.\n",
            "To help ease the itchiness of your or your child's skin, take a cool or lukewarm bath. Do not use soap that might irritate the sores. If your or your child's fever is bad, make sure the water does not cause discomfort and that it will not induce shivering.[20]Add uncooked oatmeal grains, baking soda, or oatmeal bubble bath to the water to help soothe the sores and calm the irritation.After the bath, apply skin calming lotion or moisturizer before reapplying calamine lotion.[21]Apply cool compresses to extra itchy areas of the skin between baths.\n",
            "Visit your doctor if you are older than 12 years old or if your child is less than 6 months old.\n",
            "Chickenpox will generally run its course without medical help if the infected individual is under the age of 12. If you are older than 12, however, you need to see a doctor as soon as you notice the pox appear. Major complications can arise.[22]Your doctor will likely prescribe you acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication that helps shorten the duration of the virus. Try to see your doctor within the first 24 hours after the pox appear for this medicine to be the most effective. An 800 mg pill of it should be taken four times a day for five days, but the dose may be different for smaller or younger teenagers.[23]Antivirals may be particularly helpful for people with asthma or eczema, especially children.\n",
            "See a doctor if your symptoms worsen.\n",
            "There are certain situations where you need to see a doctor, no matter how old you are. If you have a fever for more than four days, have a fever over 102F (38.9C) , if you develop a serious rash that oozes pus or gets near or in your eyes, become confused, have a hard time waking up or walking, have a stiff neck, have a severe cough, vomit frequently, or have difficulty breathing, you need to see a doctor immediately.Your doctor will examine you and decide the best course of action. These symptoms may be from a severe form of chickenpox, a bacterial infection, or another virus.[24]\n",
            "Seek immediate medical attention if you are pregnant.\n",
            "You are at risk of secondary infections if you are pregnant and get the chickenpox. You also may pass it to your unborn child as well. The doctor may give you acyclovir, but you also may be prescribed immunoglobulin treatment. This treatment is a solution of antibodies from healthy individuals that is injected to help people who are at high risk of getting a severe case of the chickenpox infection.[25]These treatments can also help prevent the mother from spreading it to the unborn child, which can have serious effects on the baby.[26]\n",
            "Get checked out if you have immune issues.\n",
            "There are individuals need to get special treatment from the doctor if they get chickenpox. If you have an immune disease, are immunocompromised, have HIV or AIDS, or are being treated for cancer or with steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs, you should get checked out immediately.[27] Your doctor may give you intravenous acyclovir, but immune disorders may cause you to be resistant to the medicine.If you are resistant, your doctor will give you foscarnet as a substitute, but the dosage and length of treatment will depend on your case.[28]\n",

            "Rinse with lukewarm water.\n",
            "If you have a diatonic harmonica with a plastic comb, simply run some lukewarm water through the harmonica. Placing the mouthpiece against your palm, tap it firmly to remove the water.[1]Only run water through the harmonica if your comb is plastic or sealed wood. If the comb is wooden or metal, do not run water through it.\n",
            "Tap the harmonica after each use to remove saliva.\n",
            "Because a harmonica is played with the mouth, saliva and other contaminants get blown into the instrument. After each use, tap the harmonica on your hand, leg, or a towel with the holes facing down to knock out any loose saliva. This will help keep it clean and help reduce the amount of build-up in the instrument.[2]Try to reduce the amount of saliva that you pass into the harmonica while playing (this will keep your tone from sounding spitty too).\n",
            "Let your harmonica dry after playing.\n",
            "Another way to keep your harmonica clean and rust-free is to let it fully dry after playing. When you place it in the case, leave the case open. This helps any moisture in the harmonica dry out instead of sitting there damp in your harmonica.[3]\n",
            "Clean your mouth before playing.\n",
            "If you have eaten or drank anything right before playing, rinse your mouth with water. Remnants of food can get blown into the harmonica, and sugar or other contaminants from non-water beverages can build up a residue in the harmonica.[4]Do not play the harmonica right after brushing your teeth. Any residue left over from the toothpaste or mouthwash can build up, too.Don't smoke while playing the harmonica. Residue from the smoke can coat the reeds or reed plates, affecting the sound of the instrument.\n",
            "Use a UV disinfectant bag to eliminate germs and odor.\n",
            "If you notice a faint odor coming from your harmonica or want to disinfect it without taking it apart, let it dry completely after rinsing or playing and place the harmonica inside a specialty UV light sanitizing bag, like the Seydel Harmonica Disinfection Bag, for about 5 minutes. Ultraviolet light and ozone kill odor-causing bacteria, fungi, and viruses inside the instrument.[5]Use the UV bag whenever you notice an odor or have shared your harmonica with another person. You likely wont need to use it daily, but it will not harm the instrument if you do.Most disinfectant bags are silicone and rechargeable with a USB or micro-USB cord. Follow your products instructions.UV cleaners dont remove debris.\n",
            "Remove the cover plates and wipe them with rubbing alcohol.\n",
            "Use the appropriate screwdriver to remove the cover plates of the harmonica. Some harmonicas use a Phillips-head screwdriver, while others use a flat head. Place the screws in a safe place where they won't be lost.[6]Then, spray both sides of each cover plate with rubbing alcohol and wipe them dry with a clean, lint-free cloth.\n",
            "Unscrew the reed plates.\n",
            "After removing the cover plates, use the screwdriver to remove the screws attached to the reed plates. Keep the screws in the order from which you remove them so they are placed back in the same hole as before.[7]The reed plates are metal rectangles with different-sized slots covered by metal reeds (flat metal springs). The reeds vibrate as you inhale or exhale to create sound.\n",
            "Soak the reed plates in warm water and white vinegar.\n",
            "Grab a shallow bowl or dish and fill it with enough warm water to cover the plates, then add a splash of distilled white vinegar (or lemon juice or citric acid). Let them soak for approximately half an hour.[8]The water and acidic vinegar help soften and break down solid debris on the reed plates, making it easier to wipe away later.\n",
            "Clean the comb.\n",
            "While the reed plates are soaking, clean the comb. If the comb is plastic, clean it with soap and warm water. Use a soft toothbrush to brush the deposits off the comb.[9] Or, spray the comb with rubbing alcohol and wipe it with a soft brush or cloth. Use something sharp, like a toothpick, to dig any build-up off the comb.If you have a wooden comb, do not use water or soap. Just use the brush or the sharp object. If you have a metal comb, dry it thoroughly before reassembling.[10]\n",
            "Clean the reed plates.\n",
            "Remove the reed plates from the water and use a soft toothbrush to gently brush them.[11] Do not scrub the reed plates with lots of pressure. Instead, lightly brush the reed plates along the reeds from the rivet down. Don't brush against the reeds or snag the ends of the reeds (this can damage them or mess up the notes of the harmonica).Never brush across the reed. Only brush in the direction of the reed.Clean the other side of the reed plate as vigorously as you want since it has no reeds.Then run it under warm water to rinse.[12]Alternatively, clean the reed plates with a cotton swab and hydrogen peroxide.[13]\n",
            "Let the harmonica dry fully, then reassemble it.\n",
            "Pat the harmonica as dry as you can with a clean cloth, then lay the pieces out in a safe spot so the small crevices air dry completely as well. The harmonica is ready to play as soon as its reassembled.Tighten all of the screws evenly before you tighten them as far as they can go.[14]\n",

Focus on what is happening in the moment and on the steps you will need to take to escape.[3]Say to yourself, I need to unbuckle my seatbelt, open a window, and get out.You will have only about 30-60 seconds to act before your car sinks below the water and escape becomes nearly impossible.\n",

            "As soon as you hit the water, unbuckle your seatbelt. You wont be able to exit the car if youre strapped in.[5]This is the first step in the S.W.O. (Seatbelts off, Window open or broken, Out (Children First)) protocol developed by car safety expert Dr. Gordon Giesbrecht.If there are children or other passengers in the car who may need help, dont worry about unbuckling them yet. Your first priority is to unbuckle yourself so you can open up an escape route as quickly as possible.\n",
            "Open a window as soon as youve unstrapped yourself.\n",
            "After unbuckling your seatbelt, act quickly to open your window before the water rises above window level. Once there is water pressing against the window, it will become nearly impossible for you to open or break it. If your car has electrical windows, they should continue to function for a few minutes after you enter the water.[6]Dont try to escape through a door. The pressure of the water outside the door will make it nearly impossible to open within a few seconds of impact with the water. Even if you do manage to open the door, it will cause the car to flood with water and sink more quickly.[7]\n",

The windshield is also designed to be more difficult to break than the other windows.

They may be able to help the younger kids get to safety.\n",

            "Try to open a door if the car is submerged.\n",
            "If youre not able to open a window before the car sinks, you may still be able to escape through a door. Take a few slow, deep breaths while there is still air in the car, then unlock the nearest door. People are commonly told to wait until the car fills completely with water in order for the pressure inside and outside of it to equalize, at which point you will supposedly be able to open the door. But Mythbusters and Top Gear have tested this theory and found it wanting. The inside and outside pressure will eventually equalize, but it wont happen just as soon as the car fills up with water. It takes a bit longer, so long that youll likely drown before it happens. It is possible if you are patient, calm, and conserve your oxygen, but dont count on it. If you have to open the door, hold your breath and push hard against the door while pulling on the handle to open it, then swim up and out.[13]It takes 60 to 120 seconds (1 to 2 minutes) for a car to fill up with water. Unfortunately, your chances of successfully escaping in this situation are very low unless you have an oxygen supply.[14]Continue to breathe normally until the water is at chest level, then take a deep breath and hold your nose.Stay calm. Keep your mouth closed to preserve your breath and to prevent water from entering.If exiting via an open door, place your hand on the door latch. If you are unable to see it, use a physical reference by stretching your hand from your hip and feeling along the door until you locate the latch.\n",

Be aware of your surroundings as you swim and surface; you may have to deal with a strong current or obstacles such as rocks, concrete bridge supports, or even passing boats. If it's ice-covered water, head for the obvious hole created by the car's impact.Do your best to avoid injuring yourself on obstacles, and use branches, supports, and other items to cling to if you're injured or exhausted.\n",

            "Grab a length of rope.\n",
            "For a lasso, the exact length of rope you use isn't important, provided you have enough length to tie your knot, form the loop, and twirl it above your head. Any extra length can be coiled up and carried with you. For adults, about 30 feet (9.1m) of rope is plenty; for children, shorter may be better.[1]If you're just practicing, nearly any type of rope will suffice. However, if you intend to actually use your lasso, you'll want a thin, tough, somewhat stiff rope. Stiffness makes the rope a little harder to tie. However, it's a desirable quality because it allows you to \"push\" the rope to make adjustments to the size of your loop.\n",
            "Tie a loose overhand knot.\n",
            "The first step in tying a lasso is to make a simple overhand knot. An overhand knot is the basic type of knot you're probably familiar with from everyday life. To make one, just create a loop in your rope, then pass one end of the rope through the loop. Don't tighten this knot - keep it loose and give yourself lots of slack to work with. You'll be modifying this basic knot in the next few steps. When done correctly, your rope should now look like a large \"O\" with the loose knot at the bottom.[2]\n",
            "Pass the tail end of the rope back through the knot.\n",
            "Take the shorter \"tail\" end of the rope in your hand. Pull this end of the rope around and over your \"O\" loop. Thread this length of rope between the outside of the \"O\" portion of the overhand knot and itself. Pull the rope about 6 inches (15.2cm) through. This will form a new loop which will become the base of your lasso.[3]\n",
            "Carefully tighten your knot without pulling the tail end through.\n",
            "Pull on the slack end of the rope (the part you'll hold onto when you throw your lasso) and the new loop you just made. As you do this, be careful not to pull the tail end of the rope back through the knot. When finished, you should have a tight knot at the base of a small loop (with the tail end of your knot extending from the knot as well). This is called a Honda knot.\n",
            "Pass the slack end of your rope through the Honda knot.\n",
            "Finally, simply pass the long slack end of your rope through the small loop in your Honda knot to create a functional lasso. By pulling on the slack end of the rope, you can tighten the lasso to grab onto objects.\n",
            "Tie a stopper knot (optional).\n",
            "If you're just making a lasso for fun or for display purposes, you're finished. However, if you intend to actually use it, you may want to tie just one more knot to make your lasso more durable and easy to use. In its current state, the short tail end of your lasso can be pulled back through the Honda knot, causing your knot to come undone and ruining your lasso. To prevent this, simply tie a tight stopper knot at the end of the tail. A basic overhand knot will do.\n",
            "Hold your lasso.\n",
            "If you simply grab onto the slack end of your rope and start to swing, the tension in the rope will pull the loop in your lasso shut before you can throw it. So, it's important to use a grip that keeps your lasso wide open as you twirl it and build momentum. Hold your lasso as directed below:[4]Make a nice, big loop by feeding slack through your Honda knot.Lay a foot or two of the leftover slack rope next to your loop.Grab the loop and the length of slack rope together. This should create a \"doubled-up\" length of rope between the Honda knot and your hand. This doubled-up portion is called the \"shank.\"Point your index finger down the shank towards the Honda knot for added control.\n",
            "Twirl your wrist around over your head with the rope.\n",
            "Holding the rope at the end of the shank, begin to swing it in a circle above your head. Be careful not to hit your head or to catch yourself by the neck. Swing fast enough that it's not difficult to keep the loop roughly horizontal, but not so fast that you struggle to control it.[5]\n",
            "Release the rope as you feel its momentum swing forward.\n",
            "Throwing a lasso isn't the same as throwing a baseball - it's more a matter of releasing the lasso at the right time than of propelling it forward. Try to let go of the lasso as you feel its weight swing forward - this isn't necessarily when the loop itself is in front of you. Rather, it's most likely when the loop is directly to your side.When you throw the lasso, let go of the loop itself but keep control of the rope so that you can tighten your lasso.\n",
            "Tighten the lasso to grab your target.\n",
            "Once it's around whatever you're trying to lasso, pull hard on the rope.This will pull the slack in the loop through the Honda knot, tightening the lasso around whatever object is inside it.Never use a lasso on people or animals unless you're an experienced roper - unsafe lasso use can cause suffocation or damage to the throat. It's also difficult or impossible for someone (or something) to remove a lasso without help, so don't run this risk unless you know what you're doing.\n",
            "4 Ways to Clean a Litter Box - wikiHow\n",
            "Set up a trash can close by.\n",
            "If you don't want to use a whole trash can, you can use an empty bucket or an empty cat litter container, and make it a designated cat waste can. It's important that you remember to set up the trash receptacle close to the litter box, so that you don't risk scattering waste or litter across the floor.[2]\n",
            "Wear disposable gloves and consider wearing a mask.\n",
            "Some experts recommend wearing disposable gloves and a dust mask to prevent the spread of toxoplasmosis, a coccidial organism that some cats carry and transmit through fecal matter.[3] Even if you don't directly handle the feces, cleaning the litter box can cause dust to fly in the air, which can irritate the lungs and may lead to transmission of toxoplasmosis.\n",
            "Scoop out solids.\n",
            "Cat feces should be scooped out at least once every day.[4] Some experts even recommend scooping out solid wastes twice a day for a really clean box.[5] If you let solid wastes build up in the litter box, your cat may refuse to use the litter box, even if the litter was only changed a few days ago.Use a special scooper, available at most pet stores. These scoopers have a grated bottom, so you can collect solid waste while the surrounding litter falls through the grates and back into the litter box.\n",
            "Scoop out urine clumps.\n",
            "If you use clumping litter, your cat's urine should form solid clumps of litter. These should be scooped on a daily basis, just like feces.[6] If you don't use clumping litter, sprinkle a layer of baking soda at the bottom of the litter box, before you pour in the litter. This can help absorb the odors from cat urine that might get missed during daily scooping.[7]\n",
            "Replace any lost litter.\n",
            "If you're scooping the box out on a daily basis, there's a chance you might have lost some of the litter, either because it stuck to your cat's waste or because it simply spilled out during cleaning or use. Topping off your cat's litter every few days can help keep the box clean and appealing to your cat.\n",
            "Empty out the old litter.\n",
            "While scooping will do on a day-to-day basis, you'll need to completely empty the litter and scrub the box at least once every week. Some cat owners may have to clean the litter box 2 or more times each week if there are multiple cats using the same litter box.[8] Keep a waste basket or trash bag close by, and dump everything out of the litter box before cleaning it.[9]\n",
            "Scrub the empty litter box.\n",
            "Once the litter is removed, you'll need to scrub the litter box, either in a sink or with a hose outside.[10] Some experts recommend scrubbing the box at least once every week, while other experts recommend scrubbing at least once each month.[11] How often you wash your cat's litter box will depend on how many cats use the box and what kind of litter you use.Use warm water and a mild detergent, like dish soap, that won't leave any harsh chemical smells or residue behind.[12]You can make an effective cleaning agent by scrubbing baking soda and a little warm water on all inside surfaces of the litter box.[13]Make sure that you rinse away all of the soap. Your cat may not use the box if it smells like soap or detergent.[14]Note that any cleaning agents that smell like ammonia or citrus will repel cats.[15] Using a cleaning agent with these smells may result in your cat being reluctant to use the litter box after you've cleaned it.[16]\n",
            "Dry the litter box thoroughly.\n",
            "It's important to ensure that the box is completely dry before you add new litter, as the litter will stick to the wet sides and bottom of the box. If you use clumping litter and fail to dry the box, it might even render the whole box full of litter unusable. You can let the box air dry, or use paper towels or napkins to wipe the box dry.[17]\n",
            "Consider adding baking soda.\n",
            "Some experts recommend sprinkling a thin layer of baking soda on the bottom of the box, before pouring on the clean litter. This can help absorb smells, and may help absorb some of the urine, if you don't use clumping litter.[18]\n",
            "Choose the right litter\n",
            ". Cats generally prefer clumping litter over non-clumping litter. Most cats find that it's more comfortable to walk on clumping litter because it's made of finer-grained material, and it's generally easier for your cat to bury his waste in. Plus, clumping litter will make it much easier for you to keep the litter box clean.[19] However, some cats do prefer traditional, non-clumping clay litter. Take note of what your cat seems to prefer, and try to cater to his choice in litter.[20]Do not use a clumping litter if you have a kitten. The curious kitten may investigate the litter with their mouth and accidentally swallow some. Clumping litter can cause a dangerous bowel obstruction in your kitten's intestines, requiring emergency care.The Humane Society cautions against using litter with perfume or deodorizer added to it, as this may irritate your cat or trigger an allergic reaction. If odor is a concern, adding baking soda to the litter box is a safe, odor-absorbing alternative to scented litter.[21]\n",
            "Pour in clean litter.\n",
            "Once the box is completely dry, you'll need to refill the litter.[22] However, you'll want to be sure to add the correct amount of litter. Too much litter will make a mess when your cat steps in and out of the box, and some cats (especially long-haired cats) are actually reluctant to use a box that is too full of litter.[23] But using too little litter can make your cat feel like he won't be able to bury his waste, which can lead to out-of-box elimination. Insufficient litter can also lead to odor problems in your home.[24]Most cats only need about 2 inches (5.1cm) of litter.[25] Don't pour more than 4 inches (10cm) of litter, or your cat may not use the box.[26]Whatever depth you choose to use, be consistent. Your cat may become stressed or confused if he suddenly has a lot more or less litter than he's used to.[27]\n",
            "Learn your cat's preferences.\n",
            "If your cat is eliminating outside the box, he may not like something about his litter box situation. Whether it's the wrong kind of litter, the wrong depth of litter, an unclean litter box, or even a poorly placed litter box, your cat may be trying to send you a message.[28]If your cat doesn't like traditional clay litter, try a clumping litter. If he doesn't like scented litter, try unscented litter. With a little trial and error, you'll be able to figure out your cat's preferences.[29]Be sure your cat's litter box is in a quiet, low-traffic area. If there's a lot of noise, like in a laundry room, or a lot of traffic coming through, like your home's living room, your cat may become reluctant to use the litter box. Choose a place that's quiet and relatively undisturbed, but not so undisturbed that your cat has to make a long journey through the house to get there.[30]\n",
            "Clean out-of-box waste thoroughly.\n",
            "Use an enzyme-based cleaning product to treat any household furniture or carpeting that your cat has eliminated on. This will break down any residual odor on the furniture, ensuring that your cat won't come to see it as an acceptable place to relieve himself.[31] If your cat leaves solid waste on the floor or on any furniture, use a paper towel to move the feces to his litter box, rather than throwing it in the trash. This will help remind him to use the litter box next time.[32]\n",
            "Keep track of your cat's bathroom habits.\n",
            "If your cat isn't using the litter box, it's important to check around the house to look for out-of-box elimination. If he isn't urinating anywhere, it's a sign that he may have a urinary tract infection, bladder/kidney stones, or a partially- or fully-blocked urethra. If you believe your cat is not eliminating, or if he is eliminating with blood in his urine or stool, take him to a veterinary emergency clinic immediately.[33]This is another reason why it's a good idea to scoop the box on a daily basis. Scooping your cat's waste allows you to monitor his health, as you'll see signs of digestive or urinary problems right away and be able to act fast.[34]\n",

            "Buy a small, flat, wooden board if youre mostly going to sand skim.\n",
            "Its generally easier to skimboard on sand than on the water, so youll probably want to do this first if youre just starting out. Sand skimming only requires a board with a flat design, which most wooden boards have. Plus, wooden boards are usually cheaper than foam boards, making them ideal for those who are trying to save money while skimboarding.[1]The typical price for a wooden skimboard is around $100.You can buy wooden skimboards at most sporting goods stores and many mass retailers.\n",
            "Opt for a curved foam board to go skimming on water.\n",
            "Once youve gotten the hang of skimming on sand and want to try skimming on water, youll want to get a skimboard that isnt as heavy as your sand skimming board. Foam boards are much lighter than wooden boards, making them ideal for skimming over water. They also typically are made with a curved design that makes it easier for the skimmer to ride along breaking waves.[2]The typical price for a foam skimboard is around $200, though some may be as much as $600.\n",
            "Find a flat beach along the coast to skimboard on.\n",
            "The best terrain to go sand skimming on is any beach with smooth, flat sand. For skimming on water, the most important thing to look for is a shoreline with a very powerful shore break, meaning it produces sizable waves that you can ride all the way back to shore.If you want to focus mainly on wave skimming instead of sand skimming, then it might be better to go to a beach with a steep slope.Some of the more popular beaches to skim at are located in San Diego, England, and Florida.\n",
            "Make sure youre able to run and jump without any physical issues.\n",
            "Skimboarding is a strenuous sport; if youre not in shape, you may injure yourself doing it. Dont try skimboarding unless youre sure you can run in short spurts, ride on a board, and take a few falls during the learning process.[3]Keep your leg and back muscles stretched, warm, and strong while youre learning to skimboard to avoid injury.\n",
            "Lean forward and hold your board about 6 inches (15cm) above the sand.\n",
            "This is the starting position for both sand skimming and wave skimming. Stand with the water on your left side if youre right-handed and vice versa.[4]While youre holding the skimboard, put 1 hand on the back tail and 1 hand on the side rail halfway up the board.Hold the board so that its parallel to the ground. One of the most common mistakes in skimboarding is pointing the board upwards before you throw it, which will result in a significantly slower skim.\n",
            "Throw the board out in front of you when the sand is wet.\n",
            "The best time to throw the board is when theres a thin coating of water on the sand between 0.25 inches (0.64cm) and 0.5 inches (1.3cm) high. If youre sand skimming, throw the board just as a wave is being sucked back out into the ocean. If youre skimming the water, throw it just before a wave comes in.[5]Make sure you throw the board parallel to the shoreline to give yourself a longer ride.You can also opt to get a running head start before you throw the board, in order to pick up more speed. However, this isnt strictly necessary if you can throw the board hard enough.When youre just starting out, practice throwing the board from the starting position a few times to get the feel of it down and to learn how hard you need to throw it.\n",
            "Run onto the board rather than jumping onto it after you throw it.\n",
            "If you jump or hop onto a moving skimboard, youll immediately faceplant. Instead, run up to and alongside the board at an even pace. Place your front foot just slightly past the middle of the board, then place your back foot behind it.[6]Using this method ensures that the board loses no speed as you get onto it (whereas if you jump onto it, the board is forced to break the surface tension of the water and thus stops skimming).Aim to take about 3 running steps before you jump onto your skimboard.Do not push off hard with your first foot when getting on the board; this will make the board shoot forward and fly away from you.Be sure to wear a helmet the first few times you try to run onto the board, just in case you fall off the board. Itll be difficult to learn how to run onto the board without falling, but youll be able to master this move with enough practice!\n",
            "Keep your knees bent and your weight centered on the board.\n",
            "This is the ideal stance to be in on your skimboard in order to maintain balance and not fall off. Put slightly more pressure on your front foot if youre sand skimming. If youre skimming on water, put more pressure on your back foot just as the board makes contact with the water so that the front of the board doesnt catch on it.[7]Maintaining a low stance on the skimboard is also a good technique for staying balanced while skimming.Your knees not only play an important role in skimboarding, but theyre also one of the more at-risk parts of your body when youre skimming. Stop skimboarding immediately if your knees start to hurt to avoid giving yourself a serious injury.\n",
            "Maintain your balance until the board stops or shift your weight to turn.\n",
            "Whether your sand skimming or skimming on water, the act of riding a skimboard is mostly about staying on the board until it stops on its own. If you want to turn to change directions, simply shift your weight slightly to the side that you want to be turning towards.[8]You generally wont need to turn much if youre sticking to sand skimming. However, turning is essential for riding waves and performing most tricks.\n",
            "Skim onto a breaking wave to ride it.\n",
            "Throw down your board and begin skimming toward the wave from a side angle as it starts to break. When youre on the crest of the wave, use your back foot to turn the board so that youre pointed toward the shore. Then, ride the wave back to shore.Bend your knees when youre at the bottom of the wave to help keep your balance.\n",
            "Try a 180-degree turn to add a more complex trick to your repertoire.\n",
            "To complete a 180-degree turn, rotate your hips in the direction you want to turn. Then, while keeping your feet firmly on the board, swing your back leg toward your back, following the same direction that you turned your hips in. Finally, continue turning your hips so that youre pointed in the opposite direction.[9]Although it sounds simple, its a bit more complex to physically perform, so dont try it unless youve gotten the hang of turning on a skimboard.Once youre able to perform a 180-degree turn, try spinning the skimboard all the way around to do a 360 turn!\n",
            "Jump and spin above the skimboard to perform a body aerial.\n",
            "Body aerials are another very popular trick that most skimboard beginners can learn to do with a little practice. Once youre skimming at full speed, jump upwards off the board with both feet and spin once in the air. To successfully complete the trick, land back on the skimboard while maintaining your balance.[10]Although the full trick involves landing back on the board, even being able to jump and spin above your skimboard is pretty impressive.\n",
            "How to Get Rid of a Stingray's Sting: 8 Steps (with Pictures)\n",
            "Wash the area with salt water.\n",
            "Stingray stings are one of the most common significant injuries on tropical and warm water beaches and reefs.[1] If you are stung, you'll very likely be in salt water, so it'll be easy to rinse the injury out before attempting anything else. The salt water will wash away any debris and help sanitize/clean your wound from any bacteria that may have been introduced into it or around it.The pain from a stingray sting is sharp and excruciating, so it may be difficult to keep calm and think clearly. So before running out of the water, take a few seconds to clean around the puncture wound.The most common areas to be stung by stingrays are the foot and lower leg. Your upper body and arms are the second-most common areas.\n",
            "Remove the stinger with tweezers.\n",
            "Usually the stinger stays attached to the tail of a stingray when it attacks, but sometimes it will stay stuck in the wound. The size of stingers depends on the size of the stingray, but most are a little smaller and shorter than knitting needles  which is still a significant size to be punctured with. As long as the stinger isn't very large and stuck through an internal organ or major artery, it's best to quickly remove it with tweezers or by a steady hand while wearing thick rubber gloves.[2] Most stingers produce poisonous venom, so be careful handling them.Removing a stinger can be more painful in the short-term because of its serrated edges tearing tissue as you pull it out. However, removing it quickly may prevent more venom from getting into your wound, which is beneficial in the longer term.Pulling out a stinger will also cause more blood to seep out of the wound for a few minutes, but it can help flush out any debris and bacteria. Be sure to rinse it in more sea water to help clean it.Pulling out a stinger from an organ or major artery may trigger massive and fatal bleeding, so in these circumstances leave it in and seek medical attention as quick as you can.\n",
            "Soak the wound in hot water.\n",
            "The most helpful thing you can do to combat the painful effects of the venom is to submerge your injury (preferably with the stinger removed) in hot water. The ideal temperature for the water is about 110 F or so, but soak the wound in water as hot as you can tolerate it without burning your skin.[3] The hot water denatures (destroys) the protein in the venom, which renders it harmless, and the heat also helps to sanitize the wound. Soak your wound for between 30-90 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the water.[4]Additional symptoms caused by the venom include: swollen lymph nodes near the wound, difficulty breathing, elevated heart rate, reduced blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, muscle cramps, headache, fainting, and/or seizures.[5]Be sure to test hot water for young children first before you soak their wounds in hot water.The area around the puncture wound will swell and turn dark red, sometimes with a bluish tint.Although the pain from the sting is most immediate and typically peaks in 1-2 hours, the symptoms from the venom can escalate over 2 days. You may notice swelling or discoloration around the sting, but more severe symptoms could include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, headache, seizures, or necrosis.[6]\n",
            "Take over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatories.\n",
            "Some of the pain related to a stingray's sting is due to swelling of the puncture wound. Therefore, taking an OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful to reduce some discomfort in the short term.[7] Painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) can be used for the pain of stings too, but they don't impact the swelling.Anti-inflammatories and analgesics (painkillers) should be considered short-term strategies for pain control while you get to the nearest hospital or walk-in clinic and receive medical attention.If you are bleeding profusely from the stingray's puncture wound, then take acetaminophen for some pain relief instead of NSAIDs because they tend to \"thin\" the blood and reduce your body's clotting ability.\n",
            "Get medical attention.\n",
            "Although basic first aid, hot water, and anti-inflammatories are certainly helpful, a wound from a stingray almost always needs medical attention.[8] Before calling 9-1-1 or going to the emergency department, it's best to determine the person's age, weight, and condition, as well as the time of the sting, so the doctors can assess the potential seriousness of the situation. A smaller person (child) has a much greater risk of serious complications from the venom than a larger person.For immediate pain control, the doctor will likely inject a local anesthetic into and around the wound. Nerve blocks can also be used.Oral antibiotics may be given to prevent infection if the wound is deep or there is a significant delay in seeking treatment. Your doctor may also give opioids for severe pain.The wound will be thoroughly cleaned, although stitches may not be applied until the doctor is confident that there's a great risk of infection. You also might get a tetanus shot.If the stinger is venomous (not all are) antiserum medication will be given to reverse the side effects of the venom.Your doctor also might want to do x-rays or another form of imaging to make sure that there are no barbs that are still stuck in your skin and to assess any internal damage that could have been done by penetrating barbs.If someone was stung in the chest or abdomen, consider getting an EKG and lab work so your doctor can monitor your cardiac activity. If theyre concerned about more severe side effects, like shock, theyll transfer you somewhere with an ICU.[9]\n",
            "Don't swim with stingrays.\n",
            "Although stingrays tend to be non-aggressive creatures who try to avoid or escape from people, some larger species may confuse people as prey or as hostile threats.[10] \"Crocodile Hunter\" Steve Irwin died as a result of a stingray attack back in 2006, even though he thought he was safe. He was punctured multiple times through the lungs and heart and died shortly thereafter from the wounds. Thus, the best prevention for avoiding stings is to never knowingly swim with them and avoid areas/beaches that are considered their habitat.Talk to local fishermen or surfers who are familiar with the coastlines and beaches about what areas to avoid.Don't touch dead stingrays. The stingers obviously remain sharp after death, but venom can still be secreted from them also, so don't pick one up.If youre fishing and catch a stingray, cut it from the line rather than trying to untangle it.Avoid swimming too close to the seafloor since a stingray could easily reach you.[11]\n",
            "Shuffle your feet while you walk.\n",
            "If you have no intention of avoiding tropical and temperate beaches, then you should learn how to minimize the risk of stepping on a stingray. The best technique seems to be to slide or shuffle your feet through the sand instead of lifting your feet and taking steps.[12] The stingrays detect this from a distance and swim away before you have a chance to accidentally step on them.Stamping on the bottom as you slowly tread through murky water can also scare stingrays off from a distance.You can also use a pole to poke the sand ahead of you before taking a step forward.[13]Wearing footwear while in the water doesn't really make a difference in preventing a stingray injury. The stingers can easily penetrate rubber and nylon material.\n",
            "Identify poisonous species.\n",
            "If you're scuba diving or snorkeling, learn to identify poisonous and/or aggressive species of stingrays (and other sea creatures) beforehand.[14] The internet is full of information and colorful pictures to help you identify the different species of rays. Some, such as the manta ray, have no stinger and are harmless to people. Before going on a tropical beach holiday, prepare yourself and your family with this helpful info.Learning the general habits of the local species while on vacation can keep you from getting into risky situations. Stingray injuries often occur in late summer and early fall, when they burrow in the sand in shallow surf.While most stingrays live in salt water, there are a few freshwater species that have venom thats more toxic.[15]Avoid going to remote areas that are isolated from medical help. The profuse bleeding and venom can be life-threatening if medical help is delayed by more than a few hours.\n",
            "4 Ways to Adapt the Way You Communicate to Different Situations\n",
            "Match your vocabulary to the audience.\n",
            "It's important to be able to speak in different registers, including some that are formal and others that are informal. At work or in your professional life, it's likely important that you appear educated, knowledgeable, and polished. However, your friends may expect to see a casual side to your personality. Changing your vocabulary to fit the situation can help you better connect to people.[1]Make sure that you use words that the other person will understand.For example, street talk and slang may be appropriate for talking with friends, but they can hold back your career if you use them in the workplace. Similarly, using big words and professional language at work can make you appear more intelligent, but it could be off-putting and alienating if you use that language with your friends.\n",
            "Mirror the language and gestures of the person you're speaking with.\n",
            "Reflecting the person's mannerisms can help them feel at ease. It also makes you more persuasive. You can copy their gestures, posture, or word choice.[2]Mimic just a few of their gestures and word choices. If you do too much, then it might be off-putting to the person.Don't mirror a person when it would not be seen as appropriate. For example, if you are a man talking to a female who is holding a purse, it's not a good idea to hold your arm at your side as though you are also holding a purse.\n",
            "Vary your tone to fit the situation.\n",
            "Tone can tell the listener a lot about the situation. You may use a serious tone while discussing matters in the workplace, an encouraging tone while evaluating an employee, or a casual tone while out with friends.When you adjust your tone, make sure that your nonverbal and verbal communication match, which will show sincerity. For example, a firm, serious tone would be undermined if you were smiling and slouching. A serious tone would pair better with a stern face and limited gestures, while an encouraging tone would pair well with nodding and gesturing.\n",
            "Schedule face-to-face meetings for new or complicated topics.\n",
            "Go with in-person meetings even if you feel like you could address the topic in an email or newsletter. That way, you will give people an opportunity to ask questions, and the have chance to clarify when necessary.[3]For instance, you might think that you can explain new rules for employee breaks properly through an email or by posting the rules in the breakroom.If you hold a face-to-face meeting with your employees, however, you can be sure that everyone understands the rules and can be held accountable.\n",
            "Address issues with subordinates in one-on-one meetings.\n",
            "Avoid calling them out in front of other employees, since this can create resentment. Emails can be misinterpreted, so it is best to not attempt to address employee problems in this manner, either. Instead, schedule a meeting where you can talk privately.[4]Be sure to use words that are understood by the individual.Open the meeting with something like Frank, I wanted to meet with you to talk about a couple of issues Ive seen in your performance lately, and how we can work on them. That will establish a firm, but forward-looking tone, instead of an overly critical one.Write a summary of the meeting afterwards, and email it to everyone involved. This adds another level of clarity to the communication.\n",
            "Use social media professionally.\n",
            "Avoid airing personal complaints or confidential information about work via social media. In short, keep things professional. If you typically use social media just to connect with friends, this might mean changing both the tone and content of your posts.[5]Keep workplace social media posts positive and concise: Hey Seattle, come on down to Toms Sports for 20% off all equipment today!If you interact with coworkers, employees, or customers via social media, steer away from personal attacks, venting, complaints, and inappropriate images.Assume that anything you post online can be seen by the public.Many people like to keep separate social media accounts--one for personal use, and one for professional use.\n",
            "Review what you want to convey if you are not communicating in person.\n",
            "Read over an email or text before you hit send. Ff you have got to talk to someone over the phone, jot down a couple of notes about what you want to say, before you make the call. Communication that does not take place face-to-face can be difficult to interpret, because you do not have context clues like tone and facial expressions.

            "Set aside time for small talk, if you are introverted.\n",
            "Go out of your way to use small talk, so that people feel familiar and comfortable talking with you in any context. Even if you are an introvert and small talk does not come naturally to you, it is not difficult to find ways to have neutral chats with people.[6]Stick to neutral, non-controversial topics. For example, you could talk about popular television shows, food, or that old standby, the weather.For instance, try something like \"hey, what did you think of that last episode of Game of Thrones?\"If you are in a superior or management position, using small talk will help your employees feel like you can relate to them and are approachable. Using small talk to chat with a manager or boss helps to establish a bond, making it easier to talk about more complex or serious matters later on.\n",
            "Use I rather than you statements.\n",
            "Rephrase the things you want to say to that they focus on how you feel or think, rather than what another person has done. That will keep them from feeling attacked. For instance:[7]At work, you could say something like I remember learning this as a new employee instead of Youre not understanding how this works.Similarly, avoid telling a friend You get upset too easily. Instead, say something like I feel like this is something you really care about.\n",
            "Bond with whoever is upset.\n",
            "Even if a person is making you upset, or you are just trying to be a mediator between two parties, do everything you can to find common ground in emotional situations. If it situation is emotionally charged, forging bonds helps to prevent people from feeling the are under attack. This can also prevent a person from going on the defensive.[8]Stress partnership in the way you phrase things. For example, use phrases like \"we can do it,\" or we are in this together.\n",
            "Show empathy for the other person, instead of criticism.\n",
            "Sometimes, when people are upset, they need to vent and for someone to just hear them out. Show that you take their concerns seriously and are willing to try and understand what is going on. This means you will have to adapt the way you communicate, to focus more on reflecting what the other person is saying.[9]Try saying things like \"I'm definitely hearing why you're upset,\" or \"you were right, that would be irritating to anyone.Avoid saying things like You shouldnt really be upset about this or I dont understand why this is bothering you, even if that is how you actually feel.\n",
            "Go out of your way to show respect.\n",
            "Defusing an emotionally charged situation requires you to acknowledge the value and worth of other people, so that they do not feel powerless or invalidated. Share statements that express what others have done well, or the rights and powers they have, like:[10]Youve really be working hard on this, havent you?I think youve been handling this with a lot of patience.\n",
            "Tailor your presentation to fit your audience.\n",
            "It's important to know your audience so that you can shape your message to fit them. You should know who will be in the audience, a bit about their background, and why they're attending your presentation. The more information you have, the better you can shape your presentation.[11]For example, if you are presenting to a group of executives that are above you on the company hierarchy, then your language should be professional and polished, with jokes or slang left out. However, you may want to include jokes, slang, and simple language if you're speaking to a group ranked below you, as this can help ease any tension in the room.Be aware of the background of people in the audience to make sure that you don't use language or examples that are offensive.\n",
            "Map out what you want to say.\n",
            "To communicate clearly with a large group, you need a plan for what to say, unlike when you are having an informal talk with a few people. Otherwise, you will risk losing the attention of your listeners. Plan out:The key points you want to emphasize. For instance, if you are introducing your companys new 3-point sales strategy, plan to get slightly louder when you mention each point for the first time.Moments when you might want to slow down (such as to introduce new or complicated information).Natural places in your talk when you can pause, such as after introducing each point of a three-point sales strategy. This gives time for the information to sink in.\n",
            "Signpost key points in your talk.\n",
            "Use key phrases to help outline the major points in your talk. It can be hard to follow oral presentations, but these signposts help your audience keep up. Good phrases to draw on include:[12]\"Moving on...\" (to introduce a new point).\"As I stated previously,....\" (to remind the audience of your main point).\"To wrap things up....\" (to let them know you are nearing the end).Tell people when you will be answering questions. You could say, \"Please save your questions until the end, and I'll make sure they're answered.\"\n",
            "Create visual aids to emphasize key points.\n",
            "Put together a simple slideshow. Use the slideshow as a way to emphasize key points, not to explain them in detail. Otherwise your audience will just look at the slides instead of paying attention to what you are saying.[13]Use only a small amount of text or visual material per slide. For instance, if you are outlining three goals for your organizations upcoming year, make a slide that says Goal 1: Boost membership 10%.That is enough information to remind the audience of the point you want to make, but not so much that they will stop paying attention.\n",
            "Interact with your audience.\n",
            "Include pauses in your presentation, asking and encouraging people to ask for questions, if they need clarification on any of the presentation. You can also address people in the audience directly, either by name or by looking them in the eye. This helps make the presentation more engaging, holds the audiences attention, and increases the amount of information they take away from your talk.[14]\n",
            "3 Ways to Help a Pecked Chicken with a Wound - wikiHow\n",
            "Watch closely for signs of pecking injuries.\n",
            "Observe your flock at least 2-3 times per day for pecking activities that go beyond the typical gentle pecking. Whether you observe aggressive pecking or not, assume a pecking injury if you see broken or missing feathers on a bird, especially if accompanied by bleeding or bruising.[1]Dont confuse pecking injuries for moulting. When a chicken is moulting its feathers will be crooked, not broken or damaged.Mild pecking is a normal behavior related to the hierarchythe pecking orderthat develops in a flock. Severe pecking is an abnormal but not uncommon behavior among chickens.[2]\n",
            "Remove the injured chicken from the flock immediately.\n",
            "Immediate isolation of the injured bird is important for 3 reasons. First, it greatly improves the chances of the chickens recovery. Second, severe pecking is a learned behavior that can spread rapidly through a flock. Third, bleeding injuries are magnets for pecking that can turn into cannibalism, which is also a learned behavior within a flock.[3]If you can identify a particular bird that is doing the severe pecking, remove it from the flock and keep it in isolation while the injured bird heals (in separate isolation). You can try reintegrating both back into the flock (first the injured bird, then the attacking bird) once the pecked chicken heals.\n",
            "Set up a properly supplied isolation cage for the injured bird.\n",
            "The isolation cage should be set up like a smaller version of the primary enclosure. Make sure it has proper bedding, a food dish, a water bottle, enrichment materials (that is, things for the bird to peck at), and so on.[4]The isolation cage should be at least 3 2 2ft (91 61 61cm) in size. A medium or large dog kennel cage makes a good chicken hospital for isolation and treatment.[5]If you're also isolating an attacking bird, set up a similar isolation cage in a separate location.\n",
            "Put on gloves and stop the bleeding with a clean cloth.\n",
            "Once youve isolated the injured bird, put on vinyl gloves and hold a clean cloth to the wound until any active bleeding stops. Hold the chicken securely in your arms while trying to keep it as calm as possible.[6]Dish gloves are a great option for protecting your hands while you handle the chicken.If the wound isnt actively bleeding, skip this step (but put gloves on regardless).\n",
            "Rinse the area with water and examine the wound.\n",
            "While maintaining a secure hold on the bird, pour clean, tepid water over the wound to rinse away any dried blood and debris. Push any feathers out of the way to get a good look at the wound.[7]If the wound is primarily red and bruised, with some bleeding spots, you can probably nurse the chicken back to health yourself.\n",
            "Seek the help of a poultry vet for severe and/or internal injuries.\n",
            "If the bleeding wont stop, the wound covers a large area, or the pecking has penetrated deep into the flesh, you probably cant heal the chicken yourself. Call a veterinarian who specializes in poultry.[8]It can, however, be difficult to find a vet that will care for injured chickens. They may be willing to euthanize the chicken for you, or you can decide if youre willing and able to euthanize the chicken yourself in a humane manner.\n",
            "Apply wound spray during continued isolation for the best results.\n",
            "After youve rinsed out and inspected the wound, apply a poultry wound care spray to the injured area. Use the spray 3 times per day, or as instructed on the package, until the injury has healed.[9]You can find poultry wound spray at agricultural supply stores.The chicken needs to remain isolated until the wound heals, or the pecking will most likely resume.\n",
            "Apply a concealing wound spray to reintegrate a healing bird.\n",
            "If you need or want to return the bird to the flock while it heals, use a wound spray that comes pre-dyedtheyre usually blue or purple in color. The dye conceals the wound so that other chickens arent encouraged to peck at it. The sight of a wound, especially a bleeding one, encourages the other chickens to keep pecking at it. It may also encourage fighting or other aggressive behavior. The dyed spray conceals the blood and wound.Follow the package instructions for using the product. You can find wound concealing spray at agricultural supply stores as well.This is a less effective option than keeping the bird isolated during treatment.\n",
            "Offer lots of water supplemented by electrolytes.\n",
            "During the injured chickens healing process, be extra vigilant to ensure that it always has an ample supply of fresh water. To further promote healing, add an electrolyte supplement to its water supply as well.[10]You dont need to give the bird more food than normal, and dont be concerned if it eats less than usual for a few days. But make sure it stays hydrated.You can buy electrolyte additives at pet suppliers or feed stores. Some come in powder form, while others are drops. For instance, the package might instruct you to add a 0.25oz (7.1g) packet of powder to 1USgal (3.8L) of water daily for up to 5 days.\n",
            "Reintegrate the bird slowly and check on it at least 5 times daily.\n",
            "When the injured bird has healed, slowly reintegrate it into the flock, almost as if it is a new bird. You may, for instance, move its temporary cage right beside the main enclosure for a few days before releasing the bird into the flock. Once it has rejoined the flock, keep a close eye on the bird for signs of pecking injuries.[11]If the bird is being pecked aggressively again, you may need to remove it permanently.If youve isolated a bird that was pecking aggressively, slowly reintegrate it and monitor it in the same fashion. If it starts pecking aggressively again, remove it permanently.\n",
            "Choose birds that have been bred for reduced pecking behavior.\n",
            "While aggressive peckingsometimes leading to cannibalismis largely a learned behavior within a flock, there is a hereditary component as well. Pecking behavior can be reduced through selective breeding, so ask any chicken breeders you use about pecking behavior among their breeding stock.[12]Pecking cannot be bred out entirelyits an innate behavior among chickens. And even birds that are bred to be less pecking-prone can become aggressive peckers or even cannibals under poorly-maintained conditions.\n",
            "Provide adequate spacing for your chickens in their enclosure.\n",
            "Not surprisingly, if chickens are too crowded together and are jostling for space, theyre more likely to peck at each other. Generally speaking, the more room to roam that you can give your birds, the less likely theyll be to engage in aggressive pecking.[13]Provide at least 5sqft (0.46m2) of ground space per bird.[14]This isnt a cure-all, however. Even free range chickens can engage in aggressive pecking behavior.\n",
            "Maintain comfortable temperatures and lighting in the enclosure.\n",
            "If the temperature within the coop dips below 70F (21C) or rises above 95F (35C), the chickens discomfort may encourage aggressive pecking. Likewise, the chickens will become agitated and more prone to pecking it they are subjected to more than 16 hours of light per day.[15]Provide a suitable heating source for the coop if necessary in cooler weather, or add ventilation if the coop gets too hot during the summer.If youre using artificial light, employ a timer to limit when the light is on12-16 hours of light per day (including daylight) is ideal to encourage egg production.\n",
            "Ensure adequate nutrition and encourage foraging behavior.\n",
            "Provide a high-quality chicken feed that is nutritionally balanced. Additionally, scatter up to an additional 1 tsp (5 g) of feed per chicken in the enclosure and cover it with straw, grass clippings, or leafy greens.[16]Foraging for food will keep the chickens occupied and allow them to engage in safe pecking behavior.Chickens that lack key nutrients or that are underfed may resort to cannibalistic pecking in search of adequate nutrition.\n",
            "Offer lots of enrichment materials to keep the birds occupied.\n",
            "If you give chickens other things to peck at and play with, theyre less likely to peck at each other. Try adding several of the following to the enclosure:[17]Pecking blocks, which you can get at feed stores. Simply scatter them throughout the coop.Pieces of your (live) Christmas tree after the season ends. Cut the tree into 3 or more sections and place them in the coop.Old soccer balls or footballs. They can be fully or partially inflated.Lengths of rope or polypropylene twine. Tie 8-10 of them to the ceiling of the coop so that they hang down to about 6in (15cm) off the ground.CDs or half-filled plastic water bottles. Tie them to the end of the twine you strung down from the coop ceiling.\n",
            "Maintain a flock size of less than or more than 30 birds.\n",
            "Anecdotal evidence indicates that flocks of around 30 birds are most likely to result in aggressive pecking. With flocks smaller than this, the birds are more able to establish a stable social hierarchy (pecking order) in which each bird recognizes all the others.[18]On the other side of the coin, the sheer size of larger flocks weakens the hierarchy altogether and reduces the urge to peck as a means of social control.\n",

            "Gather the materials.\n",
            "You can use several tools in place of the suggested tools to create a wood bow, but be sure you are using proper safety precautions. Here is a list of suggested tools:[1]62 inches (160cm) section of  inch (1.9cm) PVC pipe12 inches (30cm) section of 1 inch (2.5cm) PVC24 inches (5.110.2cm) sections of  inch (1.3cm) PVC pipe24 inches (5.110.2cm) of PVC pipe end caps (optional)62 inches (160cm) of 550 paracord  inch (1.3cm) thickSawRubber malletElectrical tapeTape measurePaint\n",
            "Cut the pipes.\n",
            "If you did not purchase PVC fiberglass pipes that are already the required measurements, you need to cut them. Use a PVC pipe cutter or multi-tool saw bit to cut the main bow pipe to 62\" long. Then, cut one 12\" section of 1\" PVC and two 4\" sections of 1/2\" PVC fiberglass.\n",
            "Combine the PVC pipes.\n",
            "Fist, insert one 4\" PVC pipe into the main bow pipe. Use a rubber mallet to hammer it in. It will be a tight squeeze, so you may need to use a lot of force. Force it all the way in until the tops of both pipes are flush at the end. After the first one is in, do the same with the second 4\" pipe on the opposite end.\n",
            "Create the hand grip.\n",
            "Cut the 1\" section of PVC pipe down the middle on one side. This will help you slide it over the main bow. Once you have it cut and placed in the center of the main bow, use the electrical tape to secure it on. Try overlapping the tape to create one sturdy layer.Face the side with the cut on the outside of the bow away from where the string will be. This is important because when you bend the bow during use, the cut may open and close. If the cut is facing the wrong side, it may pinch your fingers or rip the tape.\n",
            "Cut the paracord with scissors.\n",
            "You will need about 62\" of paracord to tie onto your bow. This length is a couple inches longer than you need, but you will lose some length as you tie the paracord onto the bow. Measure out 62\", and carefully cut the paracord straight across with sharp scissors.Seal off the ends with a flame. You can use a lighter or a match to lightly burn each end of the paracord. This will keep the ends from fraying.\n",
            "Make a groove on each end of the bow.\n",
            "Use a hacksaw, or a saw of your choice, to create a 1/2\" wide groove that sits at a 70 degree angle. Angle the groove towards the back of the bow so it goes the same direction as the paracord as it is pulled. This angle helps the paracord stay secure, and a 1/2\" groove allows the paracord to fit snugly so it does not slip out.[2]\n",
            "Slip the cord into each groove and tie a knot.\n",
            "Start on one end, and when you have a firm knot secured, bring the string up to the other end and tie a second knot. There should be enough tension in the string so you can pull it with your finger, and it will snap back.\n",
            "Place on the PVC caps.\n",
            "To help finish the look of your bow, and protect the paracord on each end, consider placing on PVC caps. The 4\" inch caps should fit snugly onto each end. Do not glue the caps on because you want to easily remove them in case a string breaks, and you need to restring the bow.[3]\n",
            "Paint the bow.\n",
            "If you want to decorate your bow with some color, try using spray paint. Lay your bow down on a piece of cardboard outside, and spray directly onto the bow. Be sure to remove the paracord and PVC caps before painting, and allow the paint to fully dry before using your bow.[4]Follow the directions on the label for the paint you decide to use.\n",
            "Gather the materials.\n",

            "Select the right tree.\n",
            "A hunting bow can be built from just about any tree, but there are certain qualities to look for. Find a tree that is about 4\" in diameter, smooth, and straight.\n",
            "Cut down the tree.\n",
            "Look for the straightest six foot section, and cut it down with a handsaw or chainsaw.  Let the wood, or stave, mature for about six months in a dry place so the wood can dry out.\n",
            "Peel off the bark.\n",
            "The easiest way to remove bark is to use a draw knife. A draw knife is a woodworking hand tool that works nicely for skinning bark and roughing off corners. Use caution when working with a draw knife, and consider wearing gloves to protect your hands.\n",
            "Inspect the wood.\n",
            "Look for the cleanest and straightest side of wood that will fit the proper measurements for the bow which should be 68\" long. Try to find sturdy areas that do not show any signs of rot or weakness. Wood can be smoothed out, but there isn't anything you can do about wood that has started to break down. Once you find a good area, use a thick carpenter's pencil to mark where you will cut.\n",
            "Cut the wood.\n",
            "Use a hatchet and machete to cut the ends. You want to make the limbs about 1/2\" thick near the ends, and leave the 4-6\" handle section in the middle about 2\" thick. To help shape the limbs to the appropriate thickness, use a wood rasp which has small teeth and is meant to shape and smooth out wood.\n",
            "Bend the limbs.\n",
            "After you have finished shaping the bow, place the bow limbs on the floor and give gentle pressure in the middle with your foot. You want to make sure the limb bends uniformly. Be careful when applying pressure, and go slow. You want to test the flexibility of the bow, but not break it.Check to see if the bow can bend into a semi circle. If the wood refuses to bend with ease, scrape away more wood to weaken the limb.\n",
            "Create the notches.\n",
            "At both ends of the bow limb, you need to cut notches that are about 1\" deep that will hold the string or paracord. Angle the notches towards you and away from the front of the bow. This will help secure the string at you are using the bow.\n",
            "String the bow.\n",
            "Tie a knot around each end through the notches. Tie off one end, and then bring the string down to the other side. Make the string have enough tension so that it snaps when you pull it.\n",

            "Dissolve alpha arbutin in water before adding it to other products.\n",
            "Pure alpha arbutin comes in powdered form. This powder must not be applied directly into a skin because its too potent and may cause a burning sensation. In addition, it cannot be mixed directly into a skin care product without being dissolved first. If it isnt dissolved, the arbutin will just sit in the product like flaky chunks of powder and wont spread evenly across your skin.[1]\n",
            "Use a digital scale to weigh your alpha arbutin.\n",
            "While it hasnt been studied thoroughly, alpha arbutins shelf life is roughly 12 months. If you plan on using it every day, use 2025 grams (0.710.88oz) or more. If you only plan on using alpha arbutin on occasion, use 1015 grams (0.350.53oz). Use a digital scale to weigh out your arbutin, or purchase a bottle containing the exact amount that you plan on using.[2]The 2 main reasons to use alpha arbutin are for skin lightening and covering blemishes from skin discoloration. If youre trying to lighten your skin, start off with a 2-month supply (around 25 grams (0.88oz)) so that you can make adjustments to your skin lightening formula once you find whats working for you.\n",
            "Calculate the amount of purified water needed to create a 5:1 ratio.\n",
            "The easiest way to get purified water is to purchase it. Alternatively, you can use a commercial water filter or boil the water for 30 minutes. Avoid chemically purifying your water with iodine or bleach since it may modify the arbutin in an unexpected way.[3]You need 5-parts water for every 1-part alpha arbutin. To determine how much you need, multiply the amount of arbutin by 5 and convert it to milliliters. For example, if youre using 25 grams (0.88oz) of arbutin, multiply it by 5 to get 125 grams (4.4oz). This converts to 125 millilitres (0.53c) of water.\n",
            "Put the water in a pot and turn the stove to medium heat.\n",
            "Pour your purified water into a small, clean pot. Set your pot on a stove burner. Turn the heat on your burner to medium.[4]\n",
            "Add the powder to the pot and stir the mixture for 3-5 minutes.\n",
            "Use a clean spoon to gently mix the water and powder as it heats. Continue stirring gently for several minutes until you see the alpha arbutin powder completely dissolve into the water. Remove the pot from the stove once your powder has completely dissolved.[5]\n",
            "Transfer the alpha arbutin mixture to an airtight container.\n",
            "Let the mixture cool for 5-10 minutes after dissolving the alpha arbutin. Grab a plastic or glass container with a closable lid. Set it on your counter and pour the alpha arbutin and water into the container.If youre worried about making a mess, use a funnel to pour the mixture.\n",
            "Store the mixture at room temperature for up to 12 months.\n",

            "Choose a water-based cream or lotion to mix with the solution.\n",
            "Dissolved alpha arbutin is generally safe in any skin care product that is applied directly to the skin so long as it makes up less than 2% of the total composition of a face cream, and 0.5% of a body lotion. Choose a lotion or cream that you use regularly to combine with your dissolved alpha arbutin.[6]You cannot mix arbutin into an oil-based cream or lotion since the oil and water wont mix evenly.\n",
            "Measure how much lotion or cream youre going to use.\n",
            "Use a measuring cup to measure out how much skin care product you want to mix. Set a small measuring cup down and pour your skin product into the cup to measure it. Write this measurement down.\n",
            "Calculate how much dissolved arbutin you need to make a 2% or 0.5% mixture.\n",
            "For body lotions, add 0.5% of the products volume to the lotion. If youre adding it to a facial cream, add 2%.[7]Alpha arbutin can be quite strong on its own and cause a burning or stinging sensation if it takes up a high percentage of the lotion or cream.For example, if you have 200 millilitres (0.85c) of skin care lotion, add 1mL (0.0042c) of dissolved arbutin. If you have a facial cream, add 4 millilitres (0.017c).\n",
            "Fill a measuring cup with 0.5-2% of dissolved arbutin or use a dropper.\n",
            "If youre using making a large amount, feel free to measure out the dissolved alpha arbutin using a standard measuring cup. If youre only adding a few drops, it can be quite difficult to do this with a standard measuring cup. Use a dropper instead by soaking up a small amount of dissolved arbutin into the glass tube.[8]\n",
            "Add the dissolved arbutin to make your mixture.\n",
            "If youre using a measuring cup, pour the arbutin directly into the cream or lotion. If youre using a dropper, apply the drops individually by adding them one at a time. A single drop from a dropper bottle is the equivalent of 0.05mL (0.00021c).[9]\n",

            "Buy nitric oxide test strips.\n",
            "There are several brands of commercially-available test strips that measure the levels of nitric oxide found in the saliva. These levels are supposed to indicate how much circulatory nitric oxide is being produced in your body. Purchase these strips online, or at select pharmacies and health stores.[1]Keep in mind that test strips might not be the best indicator of what is actually occurring in your body.\n",
            "Place the test strip on your tongue for 5 seconds.\n",
            "Nitric oxide PH test strips have a saliva absorption pad on 1 end and a test pad on the other. Place the absorption pad flat on your tongue. Remove it after 5 seconds.[2]Don't let the test pad side of the strip touch your tongue.\n",
            "Press the 2 ends of the test strip together to get a result.\n",
            "After removing the strip from your tongue, fold it in half. Make sure that the part that touched your tongue presses onto the test pad. Hold the end together for 5 seconds.[3]\n",
            "Refer to the color chart for your results.\n",
            "The packaging of the test strip should feature a color chart illustrating the possible range of nitric oxide levels measured by the strips. If the test pad turns a dark color, that means that you have high levels of nitric oxide in your body. If the color is light, your nitric oxide levels are somewhat depleted.[4]Nitric oxide levels under about 25 parts per billion in adults are considered normal.\n",
            "Speak to your doctor about your breathing problems.\n",
            "Increased levels of nitric oxide are associated with swelling in the airways, so a pulmonary specialist may test your exhaled nitric oxide levels to check for asthma when other routine tests are not providing answers. Tell your doctor about any breathing difficulties you are having. Ask about the exhaled nitric oxide test, as it may not be available in all doctor's offices or hospitals.[5]Your doctor will usually make a separate appointment for your test so you can prepare for it.This test may be ordered if you have already been diagnosed with asthma if your doctor is testing your treatment progress or considering a new line of treatment.\n",
            "Avoid alcohol and tobacco for 24 hours prior to your test.\n",
            "There are many things that can affect nitric oxide levels in your body, even in small doses. Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided for a full 24 hours before your test. Inform your doctor if you are a regular smoker.[6]Long-term drinking habits can affect your nitric oxide levels significantly, so tell your doctor if you drink more than 1 drink a day, or drink more than 4-5 drinks a day at least once a month.[7]\n",
            "Avoid aerobic exercise for 24 hours before your test.\n",
            "While cardiovascular exercise is excellent for your health, it should be avoided for a full day before your test. Aerobic activity increases the levels of nitric oxide in your body, which may skew the results of your test. Skip any type of workout, including:[8]Jogging or runningBicyclingJumping ropeRollerbladingDancingSpeed walking\n",
            "Do not get an allergy shot on the day before your test.\n",
            "Allergy shots work by introducing allergens into your system to help it build a resistance to them. As a result, an allergy vaccination may affect your nitric oxide levels for 24-48 hours after it is administered. To ensure accurate results, avoid scheduling an allergy shot within 1-2 days of your nitric oxide test.\n",
            "Don't eat or drink within an hour of your test.\n",
            "Consuming food or beverages right before your test can affect the levels of nitric oxide being released. Plan ahead so you can go at least an hour without eating or drinking anything prior to your test appointment. This includes drinking water, which can also skew test results.[9]\n",
            "Disclose any medications conditions that may affect your results.\n",
            "Nitric oxide levels in the body may be affected by other health issues and treatments. Disclose any prescription or over-the-counter medications that you are taking. If you are sick with the flu, allergies, or another ailment, tell your doctor to rule out any other causes of your symptoms.[10]Share the results of any other breathing tests you have undergone in the past.\n",
            "Follow the technician's instructions for breathing during the test.\n",
            "The exhaled nitric oxide test will last about 5 minutes. Allow the technician helping you to put clips on your nose and a mouthpiece in your mouth when you are ready to start the test. Inhale and exhale slowly until the technician or doctor tells you to stop.[11]You may have to repeat the test a few times to confirm the results.The amount of nitric oxide exhaled into the mouthpiece will be recorded for your test results.\n",
            "Get at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise every day.\n",
            "Cardiovascular exercise prompts the production of nitric oxide in your body. Aim to do at least 30 minutes of moderate to intense cardio every day. This kind of exercise could include running, biking, swimming, rollerblading, dancing, or sped walking.[12]If you can't schedule 30 minute sessions of exercise every day, break up the 30 minutes into 10-15 minute blocks.\n",
            "Eats foods that are high in nitrogen and protein.\n",
            "Nitrogen produces nitric oxide when metabolized in the body, and can be found in many vegetables. Similarly, most high-protein foods contain arginine, which produces nitric oxide when broken down in the body. Each day, try to add 1-2 servings of foods like:[13]KaleSpinachBroccoliBrussel sproutsBeetsLegumesNutsBeansFish (e.g. salmon)Meats (e.g. beef, chicken)CheeseEggs\n",
            "Get at least 20 minutes of sunlight each day.\n",

            "These tops are great options to havenot only can they keep you cool while allowing you to cover your arms, they can also help protect your skin from excessive sun exposure.[1] Search for a top that is mostly see-through and that complements the color of your dress. An off-white, black, or blue sheer top can look like a casual addition to your outfit without drawing much attention to itself.[2]These tops come in 3/4-length sleeves or long sleeves. The 3/4 sleeve will probably help you feel a tad cooler than a full-length sleeve would.You can even wear sheer tights underneath.[3]\n",
            "Choose a coverup with billowy sleeves to let air flow through.\n",
            "When shopping for that perfect item to cover your arms without making yourself overheat, keep in mind that wider sleeves made of a thin material will be more breathable than something with tight, heavy arms would be. For a sleeveless dress, a top that is open in the front will look most natural and will still allow you to show off the style of your dress underneath.[4]A nice thing about most coverups is that you can generally pull them down to expose your shoulders while still keeping the majority of your arms covered.\n",
            "Pick a batwing sleeve for a loose, flowing option that will keep you cool.\n",
            "These tops have deep armholes and sleeves that dont actually cling to your arms, which makes them much more conducive to warm-weather months. Look for a top that is a similar length to the waistline of your dress. This will allow your waist to have some definition and wont make your outfit look too bulky.These sleeves generally come to just below your elbow or to your wrist. Pick whichever option will allow you to feel the most comfortable.\n",
            "Drape a kimono overtop of your dress for a stylish, lightweight coverup.\n",
            "This is a simple style that takes just a moment to put together. If your dress is more subtle, pick a kimono that has a beautiful floral pattern. If your dress is patterned or brightly-colored, add a more neutrally-shaded kimono to complement it without  visually overwhelming.Most kimonos are made of silk or satin. The modern kimono is what you most often see people wearing nowadaysits a lighter piece that doesnt have to be secured around your waist and it generally falls at mid-thigh instead of reaching to the ground.\n",
            "Wear sheer or lace sleeves when you need to attend a fancy event.\n",
            "There are a lot of body styles available to choose from if you simply want to add a lightweight set of sleeves to your dress. These sleeves are put on first before you slip on your dress. You can find ones with high or low necklines, depending on the style of your dress; plus, you can find ones that have either 3/4- or full-length sleeves.[5]These look especially nice with fancier dresses, like what you might wear to a nice dinner or a wedding. They cover your arms without making you feel especially warm.\n",
            "Wrap a lightweight shawl over your arms for a casual yet elegant look.\n",
            "Simply take the shawl, center it around your shoulders and gently drape it around your arms.[6] Let it hang down in the back a little bit so that it isnt bunched up too much. If you get warm, let the shawl drop down off your shoulders to expose them while still keeping your arms covered.[7]You can put one side of the shawl over one shoulder and leave the other side down in the front.[8]Look for a silk or sheer shawl for the most breathable, lightweight options.\n",

            "A jean jacket would look great with a more casual dress, whereas a more fitted blazer could help you continue wearing sleeveless dresses to more formal or professional occasions. Try on the jackets you already have with your dresses to see if there are any good matches before heading to the store.[9] You may be surprised at what looks nice together! If the weather is in the between time where its warm during the day but cool at night, you could roll up the sleeves of your jacket to cool off a little more during the warmer moments.\n",
            "Add a cape or capelet for an effortless addition of warmth.\n",
            "Capes are generally pretty loose garments made of thicker materials, like wool, fur, or velvet. This might not be the best option if youll need your arms for something like eating, but its a great outer layer to wear when youre on-the-go in chillier weather.[10]If you are going to be out and about, dont forget to update the rest of your outfit for the weather, too. For example, adding a pair of tights or leggings, close-toed shoes, or even a pair of gloves could add some extra warmth to your ensemble.\n",
            "Wear a cardigan to show off the style of your dress underneath.\n",
            "This is a nice way to bring your dress into the cooler months without sacrificing on warmth. Wear a longer cardigan with a dress that comes to your knees or right below to create a nice layering visual. Wear a shorter cardigan with a floor-length dress to keep from looking frumpy. Depending on the kind of cardigan you choose, you could button it up partway or leave it open for a more casual look.\n",
            "Layer a long-sleeved top underneath your dress for extra warmth.\n",
            "Pick a top that complements the neckline of the dress. For example, a turtleneck would look better with a dress that already has a high neck, whereas a scoop-neck shirt would look better with something a little lower cut. Try to pick a top that isnt too baggy; otherwise, your dress might not lay properly on top of it.[11]There are some great long-sleeved tops that button between your legs to keep it in place throughout the day. If thats something youre concerned about or that annoys you, look for these options online or at local boutiques.\n",
            "Drape a heavy shawl over your shoulders for an elegant addition.\n",
            "A thick, wool shawl is a great pick for a fancy dinner or a night out on the town. Let it hang over your shoulders and drape down your arms to keep them warm. Look for a style and color that complements the dress youre wearing.[12]For example, a neutral-colored shawl would look nice with a dress that has a pattern. A patterned shawl could add a nice splash of color and style to an otherwise neutrally-toned dress.\n",
            "Choose a shrug for extra warmth that doesnt add too much bulk.\n",
            "A shrug or a sweater wrap doesnt hang down, making it a nice choice if you still want to show off the entire body of your sleeveless dress. Pick a shrug that is the same color as your dress to make it less noticeable that its a separate piece.[13]Depending on just how cold it is, you may still want to wear a winter coat overtop of the shrug until you get to your final destination.\n",

            "Perforations are the small holes punched along the edges of a stamp that help you peel it away from the sheet. Some stamps will have more perforations or larger circles, but what matters most is that they have full teeth (the intact strips of the border between the perforations) and clean holes.[3]Perforations are classified by the number of holes per 2cm (0.79in) of the stamps edge. For example, a perf. 10 has 10 perforated holes per 2 cm.\n",
            "Check for a cancellation mark.\n",
            "If a stamp has been used, it will be marked with a cancellation stamp or pen mark over the design. The heavier or more obvious the cancellation mark, the lower the value of your stamp. Dark marks that block, cover, or penetrate the stamps design lower the value more than faint ink strokes near the edge, for example.[4]Exceptions are fancy cancelscancellation marks from high-quality pens, ink stamps, or cancel machines. These might increase the value.If a pen cancel is listed in the Scott U.S. Specialized Catalog under Cancels for a specific stamp listing, then the mark does not lower the stamps value.\n",
            "Look for bright, original coloring in the stamps design.\n",
            "The most valuable stamp illustrations are vibrantfaded or eroded colors make it less valuable. Fading color can be caused by things like sunlight or artificial light, dirt, pollution, or skin oils.[5]Always wear gloves or use stamp tweezers when handling potentially valuable stamps to preserve the quality of the design.\n",
            "Make an estimate of the stamps grade based on its imperfections.\n",
            "Stamp grades range from 10 (poor) to 100 (superb). Grades are based on centering (is the design perfectly centered with even margins and clean perforations?) and overall quality (is the stamp used or unused? Was it previously hinged? Is the original gum intact?). There are a few possibilities for grade: poor, average, fine, very fine, and superb (mint condition).[6]Deduct 25 points right away if the stamp has minor faults like small creases or tiny discolored spots.Deduct 50 points right away if the stamp has major faults like big creases, dark cancellation marks, or new gum.Essentially, the worse the centering of the design and the heavier the cancellation mark on the stamp, the closer to a poor grade it will receive.Superb grades are quite rare, since the stamp must be perfect in all aspects.\n",
            "Leave the stamp on its envelope if its still attached.\n",
            "Its best not to risk damaging the stamp by pulling it off or cutting it away. Sometimes an old, used stamp on an envelope with a special cancellation will have a higher value than the stamp would have unused and unattached. Ask an expert at a stamp show or get a professional appraisal to see if the stamp should be removed.[7]\n",
            "Estimate the stamps age based on its artwork.\n",
            "You may be able to determine the general age or decade of production based on clues in the design, like historical events or figures. Examine or translate any words on the stamp for age clues, too. Exact years are not typically printed on stamps, so it can be tricky to figure out exactly how old your stamp is.[8]Check a stamp reference book or website and try to find an image that matches your stamp. If the year of production is known, it will be listed with the image.Head to an expert stamp dealer if you need extra help. The older the stamp is, the more valuable it will be, so its worth the extra effort!Stamps printed within the last 70 years, even those in mint condition, probably wont be valued any higher than they were originally.\n",
            "Determine the stamps country of origin.\n",
            "As with the stamps age, look for historical figures or events on the stamp that tie it to a particular country. Translate all words, tooknowing the language can help you narrow down the country.[9]A picture of Queen Victoria, for example, is likely from early 20th century Great Britain, while a picture of the Hoover Dam may be mid-century American.Look up historical currencies of the world online to help source the stamp since most stamps have a denomination printed on them.Some stamps have their country of origin printed on them, but not all. Stamps from the UK famously only have an image of the reigning monarch, for example.\n",
            "Confirm the stamp's age and origin\n",
            "with a reference book. After youve looked over the stamps physical condition, youll know enough about it to be able to find it in a reference book. Look for an image in a reputable book that matches the stamp you have. Most books will provide historical information as well as estimated values based on specific flaws or signs of wear and tear.[10]American stamp collectors often use the Scott Specialized Catalogue (also available as an e-book), while British philatelists use the Stanley Gibbons catalogue. Check out your local library to see what options you have.You can try looking at online resources and catalogues as well, but do so with a grain of salt. They may not be as accredited or accurate as reference books.\n",
            "Estimate rarity based on the quantity of the stamp's initial print run.\n",
            "The older and rarer the stamp, the higher the value. Some stamp collectors even say that rarity is the single most important factor in determining stamp value (more than condition or age). Check in reference books or with a professional dealer to figure out the initial print run of your stamp.[11]An old stamp wont necessarily be rare and valuable. The 1861 1-cent Benjamin Franklin stamps, for example, arent very valuable because 150 million of them were produced.\n",
            "Keep an eye out for valuable errors in the stamps design.\n",
            "Though valuable stamps are normally as perfect as possible, error stamps are an exception. These rare stamps have an error in the actual design rather than the centering, perforations, gum, or other aspects. Error stamps are extremely valuable because of their scarcitythere may only be 50 or 100 of them in existence.[12]Valuable stamp errors include design errors, such as a map showing the wrong border; an omission error, such as Thatcher Ferry bridge stamps in which the bridge itself was missing in the design; or an inversion, like the American Inverted Jenny stamps, which printed a biplane upside down.\n",
            "Consult a stamp reference book or online resource to determine value.\n",
            "Now that youve identified the stamp and any flaws in its condition, head back to your stamp reference book to begin to understand its value. Look for special price guides to postage stampsthe newer the guide, the more accurate the estimated value.[13]Stamp price guides may not be 100% accurate, but youll start to get a rough idea of how much your stamp could be worth.\n",
            "Head to stamp shows to have your stamps appraised.\n",
            "Stamp conventions take place all over the world and provide a place for philatelists to buy, sell, and value their stamps. Check reputable stamp dealers websites for show listings, or look at the American Philatelic Society (APS) or the American Stamp Dealers Association (ASDA) websites to find shows near you. Bring along your stamp and ask for a few different opinions.[14]Try having an auction house expert look at your stamps, too. Auction houses usually expect you to let them auction your stamps afterward, though.Many dealers and appraisers at stamp shows offer appraisals for free, although this is not guaranteed for every dealer at every show.\n",
            "Make an appraisal appointment with a stamp expert.\n",
            "In the US, look for a dealer whos a member of the APS or the ASDA. Search online to find a dealer in your area and call them to ask what the cost will be for an appraisal. It shouldnt take long, and this will give you the most accurate estimate of your stamps value.To find a dealer in other countries, search online.

            "Use a cleaning solution to clean your countertop, then let it dry.\n",
            "Kitchen countertops especially can have years of buildup on them, especially if theyre near the stove. Use kitchen cleaner to scrub the countertop free of all dirt, grime, oil, and grease. After you clean it, allow the countertop to completely dry before beginning the painting process.[1]You can use a kitchen cleaner, or a combination of dish detergent and water, to clean your countertop. However, dont use an ammonia-based cleaning solution if your countertop is made of granite or laminate.If you want to take extra care in making your countertop ready to paint, you can also sand it with medium-grit sandpaper before you clean it.Your countertop probably wont need more than an hour to completely dry.\n",
            "Cover any areas that you dont want painted with painters tape.\n",
            "Place the painters tape on any trim, walls, or cabinets around your countertops that might have paint dripped on them or be accidentally brushed by your paint roller. Expending the effort on this preparation will save you a lot of time and aggravation on touch-ups and cleanups after you refinish the countertops.[2]If youre painting kitchen countertops, you will especially want to tape off the kitchen sink and the backsplash.\n",
            "Lay down drop cloths to protect your floors.\n",
            "As with any painting job, painting your countertops carries the risk of accidentally dripping or spilling paint on the floor, so laying down drop cloths is very important. Be sure to tape down the drop cloths with painters tape to avoid displacing them when you walk on them.If you have any old bedsheets that you dont want anymore, consider repurposing them as convenient (and free) drop cloths!\n",
            "Make sure the room youre working in is well ventilated.\n",
            "Open any and all windows in the room and turn on some fans to ensure you have proper ventilation. This will be especially important when you prime the countertop, since most primers (and many paints) have a very strong odor that could linger in your house for days.[3]If you have a box fan, place it in a window pointing outside to suck the fumes out of the room as you paint.For maximum safety, consider wearing a respirator as well.\n",
            "Apply 2 coats of primer to the countertop and allow them to dry.\n",
            "Prepare the countertop with a good quality bonding primer that will improve paint adhesion when you go to apply your actual paint. Allow the primer to dry for 24 hours, then apply a second coat. Let this second coat dry for 24 hours as well before moving on to the next step.[4]Because bonding primer tends to be relatively thick, use a foam roller to apply it to make sure you get a smooth application.Most primers will need around 24 hours to dry. However, if the manufacturers instructions state a different length of time for you to allow the primer to dry, follow these instructions instead.\n",
            "Mix your paint with a painting stick.\n",
            "Its very important that you mix the paint before applying it, in order to get it at the right consistency. You should wait to mix your paint until right before you plan to apply it.[5]Although all types of countertop can technically be painted, not all paints can be used on each type. Read the label on the paint you have to make sure it works on the material your countertop is made of.If youre unsure which type of paint is right for your countertop material, talk to an employee at a home improvement or paint store to find out which type you need.\n",
            "Use a paint roller to apply the first layer of paint to the countertop.\n",
            "Pour some of the freshly mixed paint into a paint tray, then dip your roller into the tray to get paint on it. Simply roll the roller over the countertop to apply a thin layer of paint.[6]Avoid applying the paint too thickly in any spots; youll apply a second coat to the countertop later, so theres no need to use excess paint here.\n",
            "Allow the first coat to dry, then apply a second layer of paint.\n",
            "It will probably take at least 6-8 hours for the first coat to completely dry, but to play it safe, wait a full 24 hours before applying the second coat. Paint the second layer with the roller brush the same way you painted the first layer.[7]If youre using a paint kit that is specifically meant to resemble stone or granite, make sure you follow the manufacturers instructions for applying the second layer of coat, since it may be more complicated.\n",
            "Seal the paint with countertop resin to finish the job.\n",
            "Mix your resin according to the manufacturers instructions, then use a separate paint roller to spread it evenly across the countertop. The resin will harden shortly after you apply it and will protect your newly painted countertop from chipping or scratching.[8]You can buy commercially available resin anywhere painting supplies are sold.Keep an eye out for any bubbles that pop up in your resin as it begins hardening. If you spot any bubbles, even them out quickly with your roller. If theyre already hardened, youll have to use a blowtorch to reheat the resin and cause the bubbles to pop.\n",

            "Decide what kind of cards you want to collect and for what purpose.\n",
            "Trading cards often have dual purposes and for Pokmon cards, you can either collect the cards for the fun of hunting them down or you can collect them so you can play the Pokmon Trading Card Game.[1] If you only want to collect and display cards, you have the freedom to go in any direction with the kinds of cards you want. You can collect based off of Pokmon types, card values, sets, or any category you can think of. [2]\n",
            "Have a target list of what you want to collect.\n",
            "Some people exclusively try to collect rare or special cards while others are looking for certain types of Pokmon or want to catch them all. Being more specific with your list can help narrow down your search among the 900+ Pokmon that currently exist. As you start out, keep in mind that there are different rarities for cards. 'Rarity' is a term used to determine how hard a card is to find and the rarity is marked on the bottom right of the card with a symbol:[3]Easier to find cards include common (black circle mark), uncommon (black diamond), or rare (black star).Harder to find cards are either holofoil rare (black star with holographic art), ultra rare (white star), or secret rare (rarity symbol with a serial number).Some of the most sought-after cards are either full art (cards with only art), EX ('EX' is next to the Pokmon name), or reverse holos (holographic sheen is on everything but the art). These cards are limited edition and can be worth a lot of money in mint condition.[4]\n",
            "Research what kind of cards are currently in print.\n",
            "It's easier to start collecting the most recent printing of cards because they are more widely and readily available. Pokmon cards are released in sets when they are printed by the manufacturers but the sets are spread out across the world in separate packs of cards, such as starter or booster packs. Many people aim for collecting a whole set; there are generally 102 different cards per set. Be aware, sets can also have expansion packs that extend the list of cards you will need to complete that particular set. It is easier to collect a set while it's in print. The older a set is or if it goes out of print, the more difficult it will be to find those cards and they will often become more expensive as well.[5]\n",
            "Buy in bulk.\n",
            "Vendors online as well as places like flea markets and hobby stores will often have options to buy cards in bulk. You can purchase a large amount at a discounted price and usually save money on shipping as well. One downside to bulk purchases is that you may not find anything of high value. But sometimes there's a rare card hiding among a few hundred common ones. The hunt for valuable cards is part of the advantage and allure for buying in bulk.[6]\n",
            "Buy strategically.\n",
            "If you want to play the card game, you may want to focus on finding certain Pokmon or trainers and building a strong team to challenge other collectors. Pokmon cards can be usually be bought in boxed sets of themed decks, booster packs, and tins.[7] A theme deck will generally have 60 cards but will be more expensive overall. It's a great way to get your collection for playing started because it will give you a wide range of Pokmon, energy cards, trainer and item cards, as well as a decent mix of different card rarities. Booster packs will have about 10 cards in the newer expansions (and around 11 in older ones) and can cost as little as $3 or $4. Tins serve a similar purpose and are a great way to expand your collection.[8]\n",
            "Keep a ratio of 1 to 1 when trading cards.\n",
            "Trading cards with people you play against is a great way to find new cards out in the \"wild\" and you can negotiate trades to expand your team of Pokmon. This maintains that fair deals and no one is being taken advantage of within the trade. Some people make the mistake of trading several of their cards for one rare one they have their eye on and instead end up trading several cards of value for just one good card. Trading uneven amounts of cards is a quick way to lose large chunks of your collection and it's best to swap one at a time.[9]\n",
            "Hold on to duplicates for later use.\n",
            "Some people might think that duplicates aren't of any use and just take up space. Instead, think of duplicates as opportunities to trade with other collectors whether in person or online to expand your collection. It's very likely that another collector will have multiples of a card you want and vice versa, so you can swap cards with each other without taking a card from your overall set. Having duplicates can also be beneficial when building a deck and having back-ups when playing the card game.\n",
            "Trade in baby steps.\n",
            "The best way to go from owning a low value card to a high value one is to trade up gradually. Start by trading a card for another that is just slightly more valuable than the one you started with. Then, continue to trade that card for a slightly more valuable one each time you trade it. This is also a great way to obtain rare cards without going bankrupt. Selling cards is an option, but trading doesn't require any monetary transactions and you can still end up with a great card.[10]\n",
            "Pick your method of organization.\n",
            "Organization should be based on your own preferences such as whether you want to be able to pull out certain Pokmon types for battles or want to keep them in numerical order so you can know what's missing in the set you're collecting. There are several ways to categorize Pokmon cards including:Type (i.e. grass, ground, fighting, water, fire)Set (i.e. guardians rising, roaring skies, jungle, ex sandstorm)Evolution (basic, stage 1, stage 2, mega, break)Pokdex number- each Pokmon is assigned a number in the master list of Pokmon. (Bulbasaur is #001, Emolga is #587 and Oranguru is #765, for example.)Rarity.[11] (i.e. common, uncommon, rare)\n",
            "Use groups and subgroups when organizing your cards.\n",
            "You can combine different organizational methods by layering them. For example, you can have a group of all water type Pokmon and then as a subgroup, they are arranged by rarity, going from most rare to the most common card type. It's helpful to keep a master list somewhere easy to find, like the front pocket of a binder, so that you can reference it and locate a card within a group or subgroup quickly.\n",
            "Sort through your cards periodically to make sure that you're maintaining the system you have in place.\n",
            "As you accumulate cards, you want to make sure that you stay organized so that you know where to find a card when you need it. Label makers are a great way to mark your binders and tins with the groups and subgroups you have chosen. Also, have a separate space for duplicates or similar cards so that your main collection doesn't become cluttered.\n",
            "Invest in supplies to help organize and also protect your card collection.\n",
            "There are several options for storing and preserving your cards. A 3-ring binder can hold sheets of page protectors with special pockets for trading cards. The clear plastic is a great way to display your cards with easy access so you can organize the cards as you collect more. Another option is to buy individual sleeves or toploaders to hold separate cards that can then all be stored in a box or tin. Sleeves help protect from scratches and toploaders are a stiffer plastic sleeve that prevents cards from bending. You can buy binders at office supply stores or online and sheets and sleeves can be found at any hobby store. To cut down on costs, buy in bulk to save money in the long run.[12]\n",
            "Protect your cards from the elements.\n",
            "Since the cards are made from paper, they are susceptible to becoming damaged and this will decrease their value. Keep your cards safe from these possible risks so that you don't have to worry about losing parts of your collection. Additionally, store your cards in a cool, dry place such as a closet or plastic bin. Avoid rubber bands for holding cards together since the bands can bend the cards and compromise the card structure.Wear and tear from handling the cardsWater damageSmoke damageFood and drink stainsSunlight and fading from light exposure[13]\n",
            "Double up on protecting your cards.\n",
            "As you continue to collect, you'll start to accumulate some valuable cards, such as holographic or rare cards. Put those cards into a sleeve and then put them in a top loader. A binder is good for easy access to your cards, especially if you use them for battling other collectors, but using both a sleeve and toploader will prevent extra dust, water, and handling from ruining your special cards.[14]\n",
            "Buy from upstanding retailers.\n",
            "Pokmon cards can be found at major stores such as Walmart and Target, as well as hobby stores, comic book and video game stores, and online stores or sites such as Ebay. When buying in bulk online, check the reviews for a website to make sure the seller is reputable. bulk[15]\n",
            "Inspect the card for irregularities.\n",
            "Pokmon cards have intricate details and fakes can be easy to spot if you know what to look for. A genuine card will have several distinct characteristics:An accent on the 'e' in 'Pokmon.' The accent needs to be present on both the back and front of the card as well as within any text on the card.Reasonable HP and attack numbers. Fakes will sometimes have ridiculously high stats.Font sizes are uniform and a Pokmon's attacks will be in bolded font.No spelling errors.Copyright and trademark symbols will be visible.Real cards will not have grainy or fuzzy images or raised textures on the card.The energy symbol on a real card will not take up the entire circle it is in. Fake cards have an almost \"bolded\" symbol in the bottom right-hand corner.[16]\n",
            "Hold the card up to a bright light.\n",
            "Fake cards are often made from a flimsier material than the usual lightweight, cardboard type of paper. When holding the card to the light, if the card is translucent or the back image is visible, then you have a fake card.\n",

            "Use strong, unique passwords.\n",
            "When youre creating a password for your account, make sure to include a mix of numbers, symbols, and letters, both uppercase and lowercase. Avoid using the same passwords for multiple accounts. Its harder to remember, but it will keep your information much safer.[1]Try abbreviating a phrase. For example, Soda at dinner keeps you up at night could become S@dKuU@n!Longer passwords are always stronger, so try using a favorite quote, or a line from a song, book, or movie. Remember that some websites have password length restrictions, so make sure to follow those as well.[2]Avoid using common passwords like 123456 or password, or information about you that others might easily be able to find out, like a nickname, your favorite sport, or your pet's name. Also, dont use the same password on multiple sites as this can increase the likelihood of being hacked.\n",

            "Many a good conversation begins with questions but the person you're talking to should not feel as if their being interviewed at a police station. Do not fire questions at the person without giving your feedback and actually conversing with them. Nothing is worse than feeling like you're getting the third degree. Asking too many questions will only make the other person feel uncomfortable and will leave them finding a way out of the conversation.[3]If you realize that you've been asking too many questions, make a joke about it. Say, \"Sorry -- the interview is over,\" and move on to talking about something else.Ask the person about their hobbies or interests, not about his dreams and desires.Talk about something fun. Don't ask the person what they thinks about the latest tragedy on the news or how much they've had to work overtime recently. Make the person enjoy the subject of the conversation as well as the conversation itself.Make sure that you're sharing, too. Ideally, you and the other person should share the same amount.\n",
            "Be funny.\n",
            "This doesn't mean that you have to do a stand-up routine but just throw in some jokes and tell them a funny story to break the ice. You'll be surprised at how sharing funny stories will get others to open up. Everyone likes to laugh and laughing makes others feel comfortable. This is a nice way to lighten up those tense people and to get them talking.[4]Use your wit to get the person's attention. Show that you're quick on your feet and are comfortable with wordplay, clever jokes, and general banter.If you have a killer funny story, use it, as long as it's short. Don't tell a long story you haven't tried out before or you may fall flat on your face.\n",
            "Ask open ended questions\n",
            ". Open ended questions are questions that require more than a yes or no for an answer. Open ended questions allow people to elaborate and this creates conversation. You are drawing the person out and making them part of a conversation. Open ended questions bring growth to a conversation as opposed to questions with yes or no answers.Make sure the questions is open-ended enough. Don't ask the person about what they think is the meaning of life; just ask what they thinks of the Lakers' season this year.You should also know when the conversation isn't going well. If someone is giving you yes or no answers to questions that require more of a response, then that person may not be that interested in talking to you.\n",
            "Avoid uncomfortable topics and talking too much.\n",
            "There are a few ways to kill any good conversation before it has time to blossom. If you want to know how to start a good conversation, then there are a few basic things you should avoid right from the beginning.[5]In general it's best to avoid talking about politics and religion.[6]Don't reveal overly-personal information. Don't talk about your painful breakup, the weird rash on your back, or how you're starting to wonder if anyone in your life really loves you. You can save that for people who actually know you well.Don't ask the person something that could lead to an uncomfortable response. Let the person talk about his significant other, career, or health. Don't ask if the person is dating someone only to find that they've recently had his heart broken.Don't spend the whole time talking about yourself. Though poking fun at yourself and offering some personal information can put the other person at ease, if you're droning on and on about how great you are or what you're going to have for breakfast the next day, the person will quickly lose interest.Pay attention. Don't forget the person's name, job, or any important information the person reveals after five minutes. This will make the person feel like you don't care at all. When the person says his name, repeat it aloud so you're more likely to remember it.\n",
            "Start a conversation with someone you like.\n",
            "If you've just met a person you like and want to start a good conversation, then you need to make the person instantly attracted to you by bringing up something original, witty, and engaging, and by flirting a little bit. When you're starting a conversation with someone you like, the way you say something is more important than what you say. Keep eye contact and face your body toward that person, showing them that you're paying attention. Here are some great ways to start a conversation with someone you like:[7]If you're at a party, talk about the music that's playing. That will give you something to talk about -- whether you both hate or love the music.If you're meeting at a bar, ask the person for a drink recommendation. Then you can approve if you like the drink or tease the person if it's not up to par.Talk about the person's leisure activities. Without being too pushy, ask them what they like to do for fun on the weekends.Don't talk about your jobs. This is just not a turn-on. You can get to that later.Tease the person. If it's hot out and they're wearing a sweater, gently tease the girl's fashion choice.Talk about pets. People love talking about their pets. If you have a pet, you can even swap photos.\n",
            "Start a conversation with a potential friend.\n",
            "If you instantly develop a friend crush on someone you meet or see, or if you're just hanging out with a friend of a friend and want to get to know them better, you should show an interest in them without sounding like an interviewer, and make them laugh and want to get to know you.Keep it positive. Don't be self-deprecating or complain right away; open with a positive remark, like talking about how great your local sports team is doing (if you think that person likes sports) or how much you love the bar or restaurant where you find yourself.Talk about your neighborhood. People take pride in where they live and the things they love to do in that area, so if you live in the same hood, you can bond over how great it is. Then you can get more personal and talk about places where you used to live.Ask the person what they like to do for fun. Maybe you'll find that you have some of the same interests.Don't talk so much about yourself. Make sure you're talking about each other equally. You should walk away with some new information about that person.If you have mutual friends, ask that person how they know your mutual friend. You could get into some funny stories about a person you both know.\n",
            "Start a conversation with a coworker.\n",
            "Starting a conversation with a coworker can be a little trickier than starting a conversation with a potential love interest or friend because there are some lines that shouldn't be crossed in a work environment. Still, if you keep things positive and talk about your personal lives just enough, you'll be able to have a lively conversation.Ask your coworker about his family. Everyone loves talking about their family, so just casually ask how the person's family is doing. Your coworker will be whipping out photos and giving you more information than you want to hear in a second.Talk about what you're going to do with your weekends. If you work together, then you both look forward to getting out at work on Friday and doing something fun or relaxing over the weekend. Your coworker will be happy about sharing his plans if you don't pry too much.Bond over a mutual complaint. Mention the traffic, broken copier, or lack of creamer in the kitchen, and you both can shake your heads together as you jump into a more lively conversation.Don't talk about work too much. Unless you're starting a conversation with a coworker because you have a work-related question, work on showing your human side and talking about your friends, families, and interests instead of your projects or reports. Find a human connection that you can make outside of working.\n",
            "Start a conversation with a group of people.\n",
            "Talking with an entire group of people can be a bit more tricky. The safest bet in starting a conversation is finding common ground. Though it can be hard to make everyone feel at ease and like they have something to contribute to the conversation, you should try to include as many people as possible by keeping things broad and light.Poke fun at yourself. This is a great tactic especially if you're starting a conversation with people who know you but don't know each other very well. Let people laugh at you or tease you, and they'll be on their way to building a common bond.Try to address the group instead of just one or two people. If you specifically direct your comment at one person, the others will feel left out.Pet peeves make for good conversation starters because everyone has them. You can start off by telling a story about one of your pet peeves and others are sure to join in.Think of things that the people in the group may have in common and bring them up. You don't have to be subtle. You can say, \"Hey, you both love the Giants -- did you see that crazy game last night?\"\n",
            "How to Collect Chicken Eggs: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n",
            "Keep the nest clean.\n",
            "One of the most important factors when you're raising chickens is keeping their environment clean and conducive to nesting. Make sure the chicken pen is spacious enough to accommodate your chickens and that the nesting area is well-maintained.Make sure you have at least one nest for every three to four chickens. The nests should be large enough to accommodate your hens.[1]Use hay or wood shavings as litter in the pen and coop. This will help keep the eggs cleaner and reduce the chances of them being stained by mud or manure.Nest boxes should be cleaned out at least once every week, and the nesting materials (hay or wood shavings) should be replaced at that time.[2]\n",
            "Collect eggs twice each morning.\n",
            "The longer an egg sits in the nest, the greater its chances of becoming broken, dirty, or unsafe to eat. An egg sitting out in extreme hot or cold weather is even more likely to be unsafe to eat, which is why regular collection is important.Go out to the chicken coop and gather your eggs twice each morning, preferably before noon.[3]Some experts recommend listening for the sound of hens cackling loudly, as this can indicate that they're actively laying eggs.[4]Try to space out your morning collections by a few hours to ensure you get all the eggs that are laid.Eggs with cracked or broken shells should be discarded immediately.[5] Make sure you do not accidentally mix these eggs in with the ones you are keeping to prevent contamination.\n",
            "Return for a third collection.\n",
            "Depending on how many chickens you have and what kind of climate they are laying eggs in, you may need to consider a third collection. This should ideally be done in the late afternoon or early evening. That way your first two collections will gather any eggs laid overnight or in the morning, and your third collection will gather any eggs laid during the afternoon.[6]Follow the same procedure for evaluating eggs. If any eggs are cracked or broken, discard them immediately.\n",
            "Prevent your chickens from eating eggs.\n",
            "Chickens are opportunistic eaters. A chicken won't know instinctively that she can eat her own eggs, but if she encounters broken eggs she will eventually try them. Chickens who have gotten a taste for eggs will quickly grow to like them, and may even begin breaking and eating eggs on their own.[7]Remove broken eggs promptly to prevent your chickens from developing a taste for eggs.Throw out any straw or wood shavings that have egg yolk on them, and replace them with clean straw/shavings. Check for signs of yolk when you collect your eggs each day.\n",
            "Keep yourself clean and safe.\n",
            "Raw eggs can carry bacteria, and so can just about anything in a chicken coop. Manure, mud, and even rodents can introduce harmful contaminants to your eggs. It's extremely important that you keep yourself clean and prevent the risk of disease by maintaining good personal hygiene and having any rodents exterminated.Do not use poison baits, as these may inadvertently poison your chickens, household pets, and other wildlife.Call an exterminator to deal with rats and mice so that they do not contaminate your eggs.Wash your hands with soap and warm water any time you handle eggs (whether or not they're broken), chickens, their bedding, or anything else from their environment.[8]Never use your kitchen sink to wash food/water dishes that your chickens use. You may want to also wash your hands in a bathroom or outdoor faucet to avoid contaminating any dishes/cutlery in your kitchen sink.\n",
            "Gently scrub off debris.\n",
            "You won't need to do this with every single egg, but some eggs may be dirtier than others. Whether it's from mud, manure, or just environmental dirt, sometimes debris can become stuck on an eggshell that won't come off from mere washing.Use a brush to scrub dirty eggs clean. You can also use an emery cloth or a piece of fine sandpaper, but these materials will be far more difficult to disinfect.[9]Do not scrub too hard or grip the egg too tightly or you may crack the shell.When you're done, you'll need to disinfect the brush. Dip it into a cup or small bucket containing warm bleach water after each batch of eggs that you scrub.\n",
            "Run warm water.\n",
            "If eggs are washed in water that is cooler than the internal temperature of the eggs, it can cause the shell to contract, pulling water and microbes into the egg. This can lead to contamination, so it's very important to use warm water.Use water that is approximately 20 degrees Fahrenheit (6.7 degrees Celsius) warmer than the eggs. That means the water should be about 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32.2 degrees Celsius).\n",
            "Wash the eggs clean.\n",
            "Once you've collected the eggs, it's important that you wash the eggs before storing/refrigerating them to ensure their safety. Wash them indoors using a sink with clean, potable water (your kitchen sink is ideal). You can wipe, spray, pour water over, or dip eggs to clean them, but you should never let them soak in water for any period of time.Soaking eggs for even 60 seconds can let dangerous microbes through the porous shell. Never let eggs soak, and take great care when cleaning them.If you use detergent to wash the egg, choose a mild, non-foaming, unscented soap that is gentle on your hands, like unscented dishwashing liquid.[10]There are a number of commercial cleaning products designed for use with eggs. Unlike household cleaning chemicals, these are safe to use and can be purchased online or at farm supply stores.You can make your own cleaner by using distilled white vinegar diluted in half with water. Simply take a clean paper towel for each egg, dip the towel in your solution, and wipe the egg clean.Another way to sanitize eggs is by briefly dipping them in a solution of one tablespoon of bleach diluted in one gallon of warm water.[11] Just be sure to rinse the eggs off afterwards to ensure that no bleach residue remains on the egg.\n",
            "Dry the eggs before storage.\n",
            "It's very important that you dry the eggs before putting them in cartons or in storage. Eggs can be left on drying racks in your refrigerator, or dried with clean paper towels. Do not use cloth towels, though, as you'll need to discard the paper towels after drying your eggs.\n",
            "Buy new egg cartons.\n",
            "Eggs can be stored in egg cartons like the ones you get store-bought eggs in. However, because cardboard (and to a lesser extent, styrofoam) can easily absorb contaminants from the eggs, it's important that you use brand new cartons for each batch of eggs.Do not reuse cartons, as this can spread bacterial contaminants.\n",
            "Arrange your eggs in cartons.\n",
            "Once you've purchased enough cartons to store your eggs, you can arrange them for storage. Place eggs \"upside down,\" with the small ends down, in each carton.Write the date and the number of eggs in each carton on the exterior of the container. This can help ensure that your eggs are not past their shelf life.[12]\n",
            "Keep eggs refrigerated.\n",
            "Once your eggs are cleaned and arranged in a brand new egg carton, you'll need to keep them refrigerated. Store them in the main section of your refrigerator, as the shelves on a refrigerator's door tend to be warmer than the interior.Eggs should always be washed before they are refrigerated.Store your eggs at 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (1.67 to 4.44 degrees Celsius).[13]Keep your eggs away from any foods or materials that have a strong odor, as the eggs will take on the environmental odor. Onions, fish, and potatoes are some of the worst offenders that you'll want to keep away from your eggs.\n",
            "Use your eggs in a timely fashion.\n",
            "Store-bought eggs are usually sanitized and coated in a protective oil, which can increase their shelf life. However, your eggs will obviously not have such protections in place. Eggs also begin to lose quality once they're washed, so it's important to use them before they go bad.Eggs typically have a shelf life of less than five weeks.If you have too many eggs and they're at risk of going bad, you can freeze them. Crack the shells and pour the eggs into a freezer container, and add a small amount of salt or sugar to prevent gelling.[14]Only freeze fresh eggs. Eat the ones that have been in storage the longest first.\n",

            "Buy a lightweight bag to use as a sachet if you don't want to sew the pouch.\n",
            "You don't have to have sewing skills to make sachets! Buy a package of small muslin bags or use paper tea filters that you can fill with your scented mixture. Then, you can tie off the open end with a ribbon and enjoy your sachet without any sewing at all.[1]Use any lightweight bag that you have on hand. If it's made of mesh, check that your choice of filling won't spill through the holes in the bag before you fill it.\n",
            "Fold a piece of paper into a pouch to make a quick no-sew sachet.\n",
            "Take a rectangular piece of sturdy paper and fold it in half. Secure the long sides with double-sided tape to make a rectangular pouch that you can fill.[2]Use colorful scrapbooking paper to create a beautiful, customized sachet.\n",
            "Cut 2 fabric squares in the size and shape you want to sew a sachet.\n",
            "You don't need a fancy pattern to make a sachet; all you need is some lightweight fabric. Decide how big you'd like to make your sachet and cut 2 equal-sized square pieces. For a small sachet, cut a few 5in (13cm) squares or cut 7in (18cm) squares for a larger sachet.[3]Chintz, muslin, organza, and cotton calico are good lightweight fabrics for sachets since they're thin enough to release the fragrance.Feel free to cut your fabric into any shape. To make rectangular, heart-shaped, or circular sachets, cut 2 equal pieces that you can sew together.\n",
            "Stack the fabric squares so the wrong sides face out.\n",
            "Lay the squares on top of each other so the patterned sides touch. This means that you'll be sewing the wrong side so when you're done, you can turn the sachet right side out.[4]You don't need to pin the squares unless it makes you feel more comfortable as you sew.\n",
            "Sew along the sides of the fabric square and leave a 112in (3.8cm) gap.\n",
            "Take your fabric to the sewing machine and start sewing a straight line down 1 side of the square. Leave a  inch (1.3cm) seam allowance. Then, turn the square when you reach a corner and straight stitch along the other 2 sides. When you reach the final edge, leave a in (3.8cm) gap from where you started sewing.[5]You can sew the sachet by hand, but it might not be as sturdy as if you sew it with a machine.You'll use the gap to fill the sachet.\n",
            "Flip the fabric sachet right side out.\n",
            "Push the fabric through the gap you left so you can pull the right side of the sachet out. This way, the wrong side without the pattern is inside the sachet. Now you're ready to fill your sachet.[6]You can stick a skewer or knitting needle down into the corners to make them pointy if it's hard to reach them with your finger.\n",
            "Mix 1 cup (200 g) of dry rice with 10 drops of essential oil for a custom scent.\n",
            "If you already have a few bottles of essential oils, use them to scent your sachet filling. Pour 1 cup (200 g) of dry rice into a bowl and stir in 10 drops of a single essential oil or a mix. For example, use 5 drops of lavender and 5 drops of rosemary for a woodsy-scented filling.[7]You can also pour the rice and essential oil into a large mason jar. Screw the lid on and shake it vigorously to coat the rice with the scent. This is a great task for kids to help out with!Play around with your favorite essential oil combinations. Try bergamot and grapefruit for a citrus scent or use peppermint for a festive winter filling.If you don't want to use rice, substitute the same amount of plain oats or cotton balls.\n",
            "Make or buy potpourri for a strong-smelling filling.\n",
            "Potpourri is a great filler for sachets since you can buy it ready-made or customize your own. For a spicy sachet, get potpourri that uses dried citrus peel, cloves, and cinnamon sticks, for instance.[8]\n",
            "Dry lavender and use the flowers as filling for a floral sachet.\n",
            "If you have a lavender plant, snip the purple tips from the green stems and spread the flowers on a kitchen towel. Leave the lavender at room temperature for a few days so the flowers dry out. Then, you can fill your sachets with the fragrant flowers.[9]Lavender flowers stay fragrant for years, especially if you add a few drops of lavender essential oil. If your sachet isn't smelling very strong, just massage the lavender filling to release more scent.Fill the sachet with your favorite dried herbs or flowers like eucalyptus, lilac, thyme, or rosemary.\n",
            "Spread fresh rose petals on a baking sheet to dry for a delicate sachet filling.\n",
            "Buy a dozen roses that have a strong fragrance or pick a dozen early in the morning when the petals are open. Pull off the petals and spread them on a rimmed baking sheet. Then, leave the petals at room temperature for about 4 days so the petals dry out completely.[10]To speed up the drying time, you could put the sheet of petals into the oven. Bake the petals at 275F (135C) for 10 minutes to dry them out.\n",
            "Buy cedar chips or shavings to make a moth-repelling filler.\n",
            "If you plan on putting sachets into a closet or clothing drawer, add cedar to your filling combination or use all cedar chips or shavings. The cedar naturally repels moths that can damage your clothes or fabric.[11]Pair cedar with lavender if you don't like the scent of cedar. Lavender can also repel moths and it masks some of the cedar smell.\n",
            "Fill a paper pouch half full and tape the top edge closed.\n",
            "If you made a rectangular paper sachet, fill it no more than half full and fold the top edge over. Unfold the top edge and place a piece of double-sided tape on the inside. Then, fold the top edge onto the sachet to seal it closed.[12]It's a good idea to use several pieces of double-sided tape so none of the filling escapes.\n",
            "Spoon about 1/2 to 1 cup (100 to 200 g) of filling into the sachet bag.\n",
            "Make sure that your sachet bag has the pattern facing out before you fill it! Find the opening that you left and spoon your choice of filling into the sachet bag or pouch. Pour in enough filling to fill the sachet at least half full. Keep in mind that if you fill it completely full, it might be harder to close the sachet.[13]If it's easier, stick a small funnel into the sachet opening and slowly pour the filling through it. This works well with scented rice or lavender rather than chunky potpourri.\n",
            "Handstitch the fabric sachet closed.\n",
            "Thread a needle with thread that matches the color of your fabric and make a knot at the end of the thread. Insert the needle between the folded fabric near the seam. Then, sew back and forth between the folded edges of the fabric until you've closed the gap. This makes an invisible seam.[14]If you'd rather use your sewing machine to finish the sachet, don't fill the sachet completely full or you won't be able to sew across the gap. Instead, fill it half full and straight stitch right along the edge of the gap.\n",
            "Tie the sachet closed with a ribbon if you'd rather make a sachet pouch.\n",
            "If you don't want to sew the sachet closed or you're using a bag that you bought, fill your sachet only half full. Then, gather up the fabric at the top and wrap a ribbon tightly around it to secure the sachet. This makes a sachet pouch that you can lay flat or place into a linen drawer.[15]If you're worried that the ribbon might come undone, use a rubber band to secure the fabric before you wrap the ribbon around it.\n",

A vibrant Sagittarius woman can help a shy Cancer man come out of his shell and become more easy-going and cheerful. A Cancer man can give a Sagittarius woman a secure home and guide her towards being more grounded and responsible.Its hard for these two to get together initially, but if they can make it through the early phase of their relationship, they can build a long-term partnership.\n",

            "If youve noticed your dogs paws are red after theyve been running around for an hour, it can lead to pododermatitisespecially if its hot or cold outside. Friction, extreme temperatures, and excessive use can irritate their paws and lead to inflammation.[1]\n",
            "Allergies\n",
            "This is probably the most common cause of chronic pododermatitis. Just like people, dogs can be allergic to food ingredients, dander, pollen, fleas, or other environmental factors.  If youve just adopted or bought a puppy, the red paws are likely an inherited allergy.[2] Other signs this is caused by an allergy include:[3]Swelling elsewhere on your dogs body.Frequent itching, sneezing, or licking.An irregular frequency of vomiting, diarrhea, or ear infections.Runny eyes or hives.\n",
            "Foreign object stuck in paw\n",
            "If the pododermatitis appears to be impacting only one of your dogs paws and theyre limping, licking at the paw, or struggling to move normally, they may have stepped on some glass, thorn, or some other sharp object.[4]\n",
            "Bacterial or fungal infection\n",
            "Check your dogs paws for any kind of discharge, puss, or flakey skin, all of which point towards an infection of some sing. The other big sign is the odor. Your dog is probably not going to smell very good, regardless of how often you bathe or clean your dog. Your pup is also likely to lick their paws obsessively if its an infection.[5]If you notice that your dog gets infections more than once every year or so, its likely that theyre allergic to something. Dogs with allergies are more prone to infections.This might sound scary, but its sort of like a person getting a yeast infection or athletes foot. It does require treatment, but its not the end of the world.\n",
            "Autoimmune disorders\n",
            "An autoimmune disorder occurs when your dogs body cant accurately differentiate between viruses/bacteria and normal cells.[6] The most common symptom to look for here are fur loss and skin lesions. If your dog has a lot of other skin issues, its likely autoimmune.[7]The vast majority of canine autoimmune disorders are diagnosed as pemphigus. This is a very treatable condition, so dont worry just yet.[8]\n",
            "Hormonal or metabolic disorders\n",
            "The endocrine system controls hormones, metabolism, and chemicals in the brain, and these kinds of disorders often include pododermatitis as a symptom. Only as vet will be able to diagnose one of these issues, and the onset of symptoms can take various forms depending on the underlying cause.[9]Some of these issues are no big deal, while others require serious medical intervention. A vet will be able to tell you more.\n",

            "Nail bed squamous cell carcinoma and epitheliotrophic lymphoma are two types of cancer where pododermatitis is an early symptom. These conditions are quite serious, but rest assured that theyre quite rareespecially if your dog isnt old. Take your dog to a vet to get a diagnosis and learn more.[10]Other symptoms of cancer include: weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, mobility issues, trouble going to the bathroom, or sores.[11]Inspect your dogs paws for a tumor.

So long as the bleeding stops, you can just bandage the paw with a gauze pad and vetwrap tape.[13]\n",
            "Allergies: see a vet to explore dietary changes or medication\n",
            "Your dog will likely need antibiotics to treat the allergic reaction if its bad enough that you notice it, so see a vet. From there, work on a treatment plan with the vet.[14]It can be kind of difficult (and expensive) to test for allergies. Most of the time, its easier to try and use the process of elimination to figure out what irritates your dog.You might start by switching your dogs diet. If theyre eating chicken & rice kibble, try switching to lamb & potatoes, for example.Note when and where your dog has the most symptoms. They may be allergic to certain plants, so you can change your walk route, or allergic to seasonal allergens, which require shorter walks during the relevant season.If worst comes to worst, you can always give your dog a daily dose of Zyrtec per your vets guidance.\n",

            "If you cant find an object or the bleeding wont stop, go to a vet now. Otherwise, gently remove the object with tweezers. Wash the paw with warm, soapy water and rinse the excess soap out. Bandage the paw if necessary and let your dog relax and heal.[15]So long as your dog continues to get better over time, this is no biggie. However, if your dogs limping continues, it wont stop bleeding, or they get worse, take them to the vet.While their paw heals, try to distract your dog to keep them from chewing their paws.\n",

If you suspect this might be an underlying cause, do not hesitate to schedule an appointment.[17]Autoimmune disorders are often treated with steroids or other medication.The treatment for hormonal and metabolic disorders depends on the underlying condition. It could be as simple as some regular medication, or as serious as surgical intervention.Cancer and neoplastic syndromes are typically treated with surgery, medication, chemotherapy, or other interventions.\n",
            "Your dog collapses, struggles to breathe, or becomes inactive.\n",
            "If your dog has an acute allergic reaction and it happens to be serious, its an emergency situation that requires immediate medical care.

            "Suit up.\n",
            "Wear form-fitting athletic gear, such as t-shirts, shorts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants. Avoid baggy clothing, as well as anything with pockets or belt-loops, to reduce the chances of an opponent grabbing your clothes by mistake when they attempt to snatch your flag. Also avoid wearing clothes that are the same color as the flags that you will wear. Tuck your shirt into your waistband to keep the flags accessible.Although there is no tackling in flag football, safety gear such as mouthguards and safety straps for glasses are still recommended.Some leagues may require you to wear flat-soled or molded cleat shoes (meaning the cleats are actually part of the sole). Shoes with spikes or cleats that can be removed may be forbidden.Helmets and padding are not required. In fact, they are usually forbidden in official games.\n",
            "Gather your gear.\n",
            "Bring at least one American football to play with. Distribute flag belts to each player for them to wear around their waist. Also hand out three flags per player to attach to their belt. Make sure the flags for each team are one uniform color.If you dont have belts, tuck the flags under your waistband. Tuck them far enough to keep them in place when you run, but not so far in that your opponents cant reach them or pull them free.Fixing your flags so that they are harder to remove can result in ten-yard penalties if youre caught, meaning that your team will lose ten yards at the start of your next down.\n",
            "Choose a playing field.\n",
            "Find an open space with level ground. For a full-sized field, look for a space that measures 53.33 yards wide (48.76 meters) and 120 yards (109.7 meters). However, for younger players (or if wide open spaces are hard to come by in your area), feel free to choose a field that is half or even a third of that size.The game should be played on level ground so no one team has an unfair advantage. Players who need to climb uphill to reach their end zone will face more challenges than opponents running downhill.If you are able to play on an actual football field where the yards and end zones are already marked, great! If not, use cones or flags to mark your end zones. Trace your goal lines and sidelines with spray paint if possible so they are easier to spot.End zones should be the last ten yards (9.1 meters) at either end of the playing field.[1] This usually holds true even when playing on a smaller field.Recommended measurements for smaller fields include: 60 yards long by 20 yards wide (54.9 by 18.3 meters); 70 yards long by 25 yards wide (64 by 22.9 meters); 80 yards long by 30 yards wide (73.1 by 27. 4 meters).\n",
            "Gather players.\n",
            "Determine how many each team will have. To play with full teams, find nine people for each one. If that isnt possible, aim for at least five players to a team.Teams should always have an equal number of players to avoid unfair advantages.\n",
            "Appoint a captain for each team.\n",
            "Choose a player to represent the team as a whole. Although the quarterback often doubles as a captain, base your decision on their maturity, communication skills, and leadership. The captain will be responsible for: The teams conduct as a whole.Disputing calls on the teams behalf.Calling time-outs.Participating in the coin toss.\n",
            "Decide how long the game will last.\n",
            "For a full-length game, plan for an hour of total playing time. Divide the game into four quarters, with 15 minutes to each quarter. For a quicker match, feel free to shorten the overall time. Simply divide that time into four equal quarters. Or, for a very short game, simply have two short halves of ten minutes each.[2]Also, decide how long of a break you will have between each quarter and half. The break between the second and third quarter (halftime) is typically the longest. The other two breaks are of equal length.[3]Break times vary from league to league in football.[4] Halftime can be anywhere from five to twelve minutes. Breaks between quarters are usually one or two minutes.\n",
            "Flip a coin.\n",
            "Have the captain from each team meet with the referee and choose which side they will be: heads or tails. Then have the referee flip a coin. Allow the winner to choose which end zone they would like to protect in the first half or which team will start the game with possession of the ball.[5]In the second half, have each team switch sides and protect the other end zone. This way, no one team will benefit from unfair advantages, such as a steady wind blowing from one end of the field to the other for the whole game.Alternately, at the beginning of the third quarter you could also allow the loser of the coin toss a chance to choose which end zone they would like to protect in the second half.If you have no strong kickers, you can also the kickoff and start instead by granting the winner first down, starting from their five-yard line.[6]\n",
            "Start with a kick off.\n",
            "Direct each team toward the end zones determined by the coin toss. The team kicking off should place the ball at their 20 yard line. Either set it directly on the ground or on a kicking tee, or have a player hold it in place for the kicker. Once the referee blows the whistle to start the game, kick the ball toward the other team. Whoever catches the ball on the other team may: Run the ball toward the opposite zone.Execute a forward pass to another teammate.\n",
            "Start with a snap instead.\n",
            "If you have no strong kickers, forget the kick-off. Simply start the game at the 5 yard line of whichever team possesses the ball according to the coin toss.[7] Line at least four players along the line of scrimmage, with the center (the player snapping the ball to the quarterback) in the center of the field. Place the quarterback behind the center. At the whistle, proceed to play as you would after your first down.[8]A snap is the backward pass from center to quarterback. It must be passed from between the centers legs.'A down is the interval of time when the ball is in play, starting from the center snapping the ball and ending with a touchdown or the ball going dead (meaning when an offensive players flag is removed by a defender or they go out of bounds). A player is also declared down when the ball is declared \"dead.\"The lines of scrimmage are two parallel lines extending from sideline to sideline, with each line crossing one end of the football, which in this case is placed on the 5 yard line with either end pointing toward an end zone.The neutral zone is the area between each line of scrimmage at the start of each down. Neither team may cross into the neutral zone until the ball is snapped.\n",
            "Cover the most ground possible.\n",
            "Whether you receive a kick-off or start with a snap, always aim to carry the ball as far as you can toward the opposite end zone. If you catch a kick-off, pass the ball to a teammate if they have a better chance of gaining more ground. Advance the ball as far as possible until you either reach the end zone and score a touchdown or are declared down enroute.When catching a kick-off, your entire body must be within bounds for the catch to count. The only exception is if you have to leap into the air to catch the ball, in which case one foot still must land within bounds. This rule is not universal, though, so have all sides agree to it before the start of the game if you wish to adopt it.If you are unable to make it all the way to the end zone, you are down as soon as your opponents snatch one of your flags or force you out of bounds.Although tackling is not permitted, you are still considered down if any part of your body other than your hands or feet comes into contact with the ground.\n",
            "Get ready to play your first down.\n",
            "Place the ball in the center of the field at the exact yard where it went dead (that is, the yard line where you were declared down). Assemble your team along your line of scrimmage. Position four players at the line of scrimmage itself, with the quarterback positioned behind whoever is playing center and snapping the ball to them.[9]To be considered at the line of scrimmage, at least one part of your body (foot, upper torso, head, etc.) has to be within a yard of it.Replace the flag that was snatched before you get into position. Starting a down with one less flag for your opponents to try for will automatically result in you being declared down again.\n",
            "Snap the ball.\n",
            "Have the center pass the ball to the quarterback from between their legs in one fast, fluid motion. Until they do, the center must not shift their feet or raise their hands once they are in position. Be aware that any false start on the centers part will result in a five-yard penalty, meaning that you will have to retreat five yards.No one is allowed to cross into the neutral zone until the ball has been snapped. Doing so will also result in a five-yard penalty.Some rules dictate that all players must refrain from moving at all until the ball is snapped.[10]Other rules allow players to move parallel to the line of scrimmage or farther back from it.\n",
            "Pass or run the ball.\n",
            "Once the ball has been snapped, have the quarterback pass the ball to another player as they advance toward the end zone. Alternately, they can hand the ball off to another player behind the line of scrimmage, or they can run the ball themselves toward the end zone if no one is open. Be aware, however, that they are no longer allowed to pass the ball once they cross the line of scrimmage.Only one forward pass is permitted during one down.A successful handoff to another player behind the line of scrimmage does not count as a forward pass, meaning this second player can then make a forward pass as long as they dont cross the line of scrimmage.You may make as many backward passes as necessary.[11]\n",
            "Play four downs.\n",
            "Aim to gain at least ten yards in that time. Once you do, consider your next down your first, with four more chances to gain another ten yards. Keep advancing toward the opposite end zone in this manner.[12]If you do not gain ten yards in four downs, surrender possession of the ball to your opponents, who may now start their own offensive run from your last line of scrimmage.Once the line of scrimmage is within five yards of the end zone, you can only score by throwing a successful pass into the end zone, not by running the ball across the goal line.[13]\n",
            "Cover each opponent.\n",
            "When the other team assembles along the line of scrimmage to snap the ball, place your own players so that each of the other teams receivers will be covered once the ball is snapped. Place them as you see fit, since the defensive team is not obligated to place any players directly on the line of scrimmage. However, be sure to follow these rules:Do not place a player directly across from your opponents center at the line of scrimmage.Wait until the ball is snapped before crossing the neutral zone.\n",
            "Intercept passes and collect fumbles.\n",
            "Turn your defense into an offense at any given opportunity. If possible, try to catch any passes thrown by your opponents and make a run for your end zone. If your opponents drop the ball without going down, try to recover it to claim possession for your team.If you and your opponent catch the ball at the exact same time, the ball is still theirs.[14]Do not physically interfere with an offensive player to prevent them from catching a ball. This will result in a ten-yard penalty.\n",
            "Snatch their flags.\n",
            "Instead of tackling your opponents, rip one of their flags from their belt or waistband once they catch the ball. If one or more of their flags have come off accidentally, use your hand to touch them anywhere between their shoulders and their knees.[15].If your opponent has all of his flags, refrain from touching their body at all. Doing so will automatically grant them an extra ten yards as a penalty against you.As soon as you have hold of their flag, raise it in the air so others see that you have it.\n",
            "Refrain from rough play.\n",
            "Remember that flag football is a much gentler variation on traditional football. Expect roughhousing to be penalized. Avoid physical contact with your opponents, except for their flags. Refrain from:Physically forcing your opponent out of bounds.Tackling them or trying to injure them with your arms or legs.\n",

Use your fingers to section off the hair, and grasp a small section of hair in your hand.

Repeat this motion until there is a cushion of hair at the base of the hair section.At this point your hair will look wild. That's totally normal!

You need enough pressure to blend the hair together to cover or hide the back combed areas but not enough to flatten out the areas where you just added volume.

            "Arguing with paranoia can make things worse.\n",
            "No matter how many rational arguments you might have for why someones paranoid thinking doesnt make sense, its best to put these aside for the time being. Reasoning with upset individuals is not reasonable.[2] Trying to prove them wrong can make someone experiencing paranoia feel attacked. Instead, empathize with their experience of fear and uncertainty.[3] You can say something like:[4]I can understand why youre upset. If I thought that my neighbors were planning to hurt me, Id feel a lot of fear too.I know that it must be scary to feel like you cant trust anyone around you.\n",
            "Paranoia can make people feel confused, so be clear and direct.\n",
            "Someone experiencing paranoia may be feeling like their thoughts are moving too quickly and out of their control. When speaking to someone who is going through this experience, its important that you try and make sure that your language is as unambiguous as possible. Speak in short, direct sentences, and be prepared to repeat yourself calmly if necessary.[5]For example, you might say something like, Would you like to take a seat? I think we might feel more comfortable if we sit down.\n",
            "Put them at ease by explaining you understand their accusations.\n",
            "Then, point out to them why you dont see things the same way in as friendly a tone as possible. By both validating their fears and providing an alternative explanation, you may be able to help someone with paranoia adopt an alternative point of view. Try saying something like:[6]I know that your husband not returning your calls makes you worried. I think that it could be the case that he really has been busy at work and hasnt been able to reach youI know I ignore my phone when this happens to me.I can see why all of the houses having their lights off might be unnerving. The way I see it, I feel like most people in the neighborhood decided to get away for the long weekend.\n",
            "Narrating your actions can calm a paranoid person.\n",
            "Someone experiencing paranoia might feel suspicious about all of your actions, so by addressing them explicitly, you can help assure the paranoid person that you arent doing anything behind their back. For example, you might say something like:[7]Im going to open the door now. Theres no need to be alarmed when I come inI dont mean to cause you any harm.Im going to use my phone to call your sister. You can watch me do this if you want to.\n",
            "Paranoia can cause people to distance themselves.\n",
            "Respect this distance, and avoid coming close to them unless they specifically request it. Giving someone experiencing paranoia their personal space can keep them from feeling threatened by you. Stand or sit at a respectful distance from them, without blocking any exits.[8]\n",
            "Loud noises or too many people can be very stressful.\n",
            "If someone is experiencing paranoia, its a good idea to try and reduce the amount of things in the environment that could be adding to their stress. This might mean turning on the lights, moving them into a place with fewer people, or turning down any music playing in the background.[9]\n",
            "Help someone with paranoia not dwell in it for too long.\n",
            "Giving them an activity to do, if theyre up for it, can take their focus off of their paranoid thinking. Paranoid people can feel isolated and distant from everyone else, so offering them an opportunity to help out with simple chores can give them a feeling of belonging. For example, you might say something like:[10]I know that your mind must be racing with all kinds of thoughts right now. How about if we clean some dishes together, then come back to this conversation?Youre going through a hard time right now. Maybe you would want to spend some time with me in the garden? I saw some weeds out there that need to be pulled.\n",
            "Treat episodes of paranoia as learning experiences for you.\n",
            "For some people, paranoid accusations might be the result of an episode of psychosis, and once the episode ends, they'll return to being calmer and more rational. Although youre probably feeling thankful just to be done with this stressful experience, revisiting what happened can help you understand what your loved one needs from you during future moments of paranoia.[11]Say something like: Im glad youre feeling calmer. How about if we talk about what happened?If they falsely accused you of something, you can have an open discussion with them.[12]\n",
            "Bring up treatment only when someone is calm.\n",
            "Being told that they need mental health treatment can create a lot of anxiety and fear in someone struggling with paranoia. Try not to use medicalizing terminology. Instead of saying things like Youre paranoid or You have a mental health disorder, tell them something like I think youre really struggling, and could use a stress-free conversation with a therapist. Could I help you find an appointment?[13]This might be a conversation that you have to revisit a number of times. Be persistent in offering help, but know that it might take time before they agree to seek it out themselves.[14]\n",
            "Someones disordered thinking doesnt say anything about you.\n",
            "When someone is experiencing paranoia, they might lash out at you in ways that can feel personal and damaging. Its important to take a step back and have some perspective in moments like this. The person with paranoia is also in a great deal of suffering, so try to treat them with gentleness.[15]If someones accusations have gone too far and they present a genuine threat to your physical safety, you may have to get emergency services involved.[16]If you do call 911, tell the operator that youre dealing with a psychiatric emergency and need someone trained in crisis intervention.[17]\n",
            "You wont always respond perfectly, and thats okay.\n",
            "Its natural to sometimes get too defensive when faced with hurtful accusations. But if this is something that you experience with this person on a regular basis, remember that youll get better at dealing with these episodes over time. Accept that you wont always react with perfect calm and poiseyoure only human.[18]Remember to take care of yourself and spend time away from the orbit of your loved one who experiences paranoia. Eating, sleeping, and exercising well is important to maintain your mental strength.If you feel a lot of stress from dealing with your loved ones paranoia, this is completely understandable. It might be a good idea to talk to a therapist to process your emotions.\n",

            "Remove the laces from your boots to access their entire surface.\n",
            "Having easy access to the entire surface of your boots is important for creating an even shine. To create a sturdier space to work on, you can insert shoe trees into your boots.Shoe trees can be replaced by wadding up a newspaper and inserting it into the toe of your boot.[1]For boots with taller necks, wad up some old t-shirts or towels and pack them tightly into the neck of your boots. This will make the necks easier to handle as you polish.\n",
            "Use your horsehair brush to clean any debris from your boots.\n",
            "This step should always be done before you begin polishing. Even if your boots do not appear to be incredibly dirty, they may still be covered with dust and small debris that may be hard to see. If you just polish over that, you're actually working that dirt deeper into your boots.[2] Start by gently brushing your boots surface. Pay close attention to any areas of dirt, dust, and other debris. Make sure that the debris is completely removed before continuing.\n",
            "Use saddle soap if your boots need a deeper clean.\n",
            "Dip a damp cloth in saddle soap and rub that into your shoes. If you don't have any saddle soap, use just a little baby shampoo mixed with a small amount of water. Either way, make sure not to saturate your shoe when you're cleaning it, as that will damage the leather.[3] Use a welt brush and a dab of water to reach smaller areas and openings in your boot such as the eyelets and the welts. However, do not soak your boot when applying the water. Allow your shoes 10-15 minutes to dry before continuing, and make sure every area of your shoe has dried completely.\n",
            "Cover your work area with newspapers or a towel.\n",
            "Polishing your boots can be a messy ordeal. Make sure to take the proper precautions before applying your polish and save yourself the potential frustration of dealing with a stained kitchen table.[4]Dont use your favorite bathroom or kitchen towels to cover the area as some polishes can leave a permanent stain.Do not wear your boots for at least 24 hours after polishing.\n",
            "Use a cream or wax based polish.\n",
            "These will provide better nourishment and coloring for your boots. Wax based polishes have a higher concentration of hard wax that will create a better shine. Because of the stronger concentration of wax, this type of polish will help you protect your boots from liquids, scratches, and scuffs.[5]For oil-tanned leather, use an oil or conditioner for polishing. Simply use a clean cloth, dab it into the oil or conditioner, and lightly spread it thoroughly across your boot. Oil-tanned leather will have been treated with oil to help make the boots more resistant to various types of weather.[6]When treating suede or rough out based leather, do not use oil, polish, or conditioner, as it is not needed. Use a leather protector spray instead.\n",
            "Dip one corner of a clean, lint-free rag into your polish.\n",
            "Begin by only submerging one corner of the cloth into your polish at a time. Ensure that the corner gets fully saturated before you start applying the polish to your boots.[7]Ensuring that the corner of your cloth is saturated before applying your polish will help you create a smooth, even coat. This will also help prevent you from making the coat too thick.\n",
            "Use a small, circular motion to apply your polish.\n",
            "Begin applying the polish to one small area, such as the toe of your boot, at a time. This will ensure that you are not missing any scuffs or scrapes that could possibly be overlooked. Continue to use small, circular motions as you apply polish to the remaining area of your boot, re-saturating your cloth with polish as needed.[8]Only apply a very thin layer of the polish to your shoesif you put on too much, it's just going to sit on the surface of the leather, and it's not going to soak in.[9]Using a circular motion will help the wax or cream to spread evenly over the surface of your boot.\n",
            "Make sure to polish the welts of your shoes.\n",
            "To do so, dip a welt brush or toothbrush into the polish. Apply the polish to your boot using small, circular motions, when able to.

            "Add a small amount of wax to the damp cloth on your fingertip.\n",
            "The smaller amount of wax you use here, the better. Using too much wax will take too long to dry and will not dry evenly.Thick layers of wax can cause the wax to be absorbed by the leather and will ruin the base coat you just made.\n",
            "Use a small, quick circular motion to apply the wax.\n",
            "You will want to have a very light touch while applying the wax. If you press too hard during application, you could be rubbing off any polish that has not yet been completely dissolved. Instead, you want to use the small amount of wax to create a light, smooth coat over the hardened polish.Do not worry if there is an increase in friction between your finger and your boot along with a matted or cloudy texture. This only means that the wax is beginning to harden and you will want to continue shaping it into a smooth layer.If needed, you can add a drop of water to the hardening wax and continue to massage it with light, circular motions. Continue to add one drop of water at a time until the matted texture disappears.\n",
            "Allow the wax to dry for at least 10-15 minutes.\n",
            "Providing the wax the appropriate amount of time to dry will prevent thick layers of wax from building up. If you dont allow your wax to dry thoroughly, it will prevent the wax from building a protective layer.Allowing the wax time to dry is particularly important if you plan to apply another layer.\n",
            "Reapply the wax until you achieve your desired level of shine.\n",
            "Even when reapplying the wax, make sure to follow the previous steps exactly. Applying too much wax will create a hard surface that will not result in a shiny finish.Be patient during this process. Depending on the state of your boots, they may take more applications of wax for your desired outcome. Dont rush the process, as rushing through the steps will not help you get your desired finish.\n",

These cameras turn off quickly, so simply repeat the process whenever youre ready to take a picture.[3]If you cant see your flashbar on a 600-series Polaroid OneStep camera, that means you have a model that requires you to flip it up.Polaroid SX-70 Land cameras do not have an on/off button. These cameras are ready to use as soon as your film is loaded.[4]\n",
            "Play with your exposure compensation switch to fix exposure problems.\n",
            "A cameras exposure refers to the camera and films sensitivity to light, which will then be captured in the image. Most OneStep models include a small slider that increases or decreases the amount of light the camera will let in. Experiment with multiple shots at different exposure levels to see what produces the best results for your film and camera.[5]If youre shooting with Impossible Project SX-70 film, move the switch toward the darker side. This film has higher light sensitivity, which will make images appear over-exposed if the switch remains in the middle of the slider.\n",
            "Stand at least 4 feet (1.22 m) away from your subject.\n",
            "Because OneStep cameras contain fixed-focus lenses, they use distance, or depth of field, to focus on their subjects. They dont contain the electronics necessary for autofocus. Provide enough distance between yourself and your chosen subject to allow the camera to produce a sharp image. You may need to experiment with distance when taking photographs with Polaroid cameras. Some models may produce better images at a distance of about 10 feet (3.04 m). Some models may not work at distances above 10 feet (3.04 m), so be patient and get ready to test out your camera.Some models may include a closeup setting that is supposed to allow you take pictures of subjects located under 4 feet (1.22 m) away from you. Unfortunately, these settings generally dont work very well. Ignore them, and adhere to the 4-foot (1.22-m) rule.[6]\n",
            "Use the viewfinder to frame your shot.\n",
            "Unlike most modern cameras, the viewfinder doesnt allow you to see through the cameras lens. Since the viewfinder doesnt provide you with a perfect replica of what the image will be, give yourself plenty of room on either side of your chosen subject when framing your shot.[7]\n",

            "Keep your photos face-down or shielded from light the entire time theyre developing. While some old Polaroid film may be ready within 90 seconds, its safer to wait longer. If youre using the Impossible Projects new film, be especially cautious. Youd rather have a properly developed picture after a half-hour than a dud after five minutes.[10]The Impossible Project recommends waiting 10 minutes for black-and-white film and 30 for color film.\n",
            "Shoot outdoors for best results.\n",
            "Polaroid cameras respond well to lots of natural light. They do best with outdoor shots taken on either sunny or slightly overcast days. When youre starting out, try taking landscape shots first. This will allow you to get comfortable with your camera.[11]\n",
            "Avoid extreme heat or cold when shooting with Impossible film.\n",
            "This new film does best in temperate temperatures between about 55 (13) and 82 (28). Cold weather may lead to overexposed prints that dont contain color contrast, while hot days could give you pictures with a red or yellow tint. To shoot at higher or lower temperatures, either heat up the film by placing it in a pocket and using your body heat or cool it down by putting in the refrigerator before taking your photos.\n",

            "Observe the nodule to make sure it doesnt grow.\n",
            "The watchful waiting procedure is the most common approach for benign nodules, no matter where they are. Your doctor will observe the nodule for a 6-18-month period to see if it grows or changes. If not, then the doctor will probably leave the nodule alone with no further treatment.[1]Stay in contact with your doctor during the watching period. If you notice the nodule growing or changing in shape, schedule an exam.\n",

Try a mixture of 400 mg of spirulina, 50 mg of curcumin, and 50 mg of Boswellia twice a day. This treatment showed some success in shrinking thyroid nodules after 3 months.[2]Ask your doctor before trying any herbal treatments like this to make sure its safe for you.\n",
            "Avoid using Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment for nodules.\n",
            "While some websites claim that mixtures from Chinese herbal medicine are an effective nodule treatment, studies don't prove this. There is no information confirming that these treatments work on nodules, so skip them unless your doctor recommends them.[3]\n",
            "Don't try to treat nodules with dietary changes.\n",
            "Some websites claim that eating more fruit, yogurt, and dietary supplements while cutting out fatty foods will shrink nodules. These are mostly good dietary tips, but they won't shrink your nodules, so don't rely on this as a treatment.Following a good diet high in fruits and vegetables does lower your risk of cancer, particularly thyroid cancer. However, this still won't shrink your nodules.[4]\n",
            "Have a biopsy to confirm that the nodule is benign.\n",
            "While it's very rare, there's a small chance that a growth on your body could be cancerous. Whenever your doctor examines a nodule, they will probably want to do a biopsy to confirm that the growth isnt cancerous. During a biopsy, the doctor will take a small sample from the nodule and test it for cancer cells. In most cases, this comes back negative and confirms that the nodule is benign.[5]The biopsy procedure might be different depending on where the nodule is. For a thyroid nodule, the doctor may insert a small needle into your neck.[6] For a lung nodule, they may insert a small tube down your throat.[7]Biopsies are standard medical procedures, and having one done doesnt mean that you have cancer. Over 90% of nodules are benign and non-cancerous, so the biopsy is just a precaution.[8]\n",

This might shrink the nodules and correct any other complications.[9]If you have an underactive thyroid, the doctor will probably prescribe synthetic thyroid hormones to boost your thyroid function.If you have an overactive thyroid, the doctor may prescribe an anti-thyroid medication like Tapazole to reduce thyroid function.All of these medications are powerful, so take them exactly as your doctor directs you to.\n",
            "Correct adrenal nodules with hormone medications.\n",
            "Nodules on your adrenal glands could interfere with your body's hormone levels. If your doctor discovers that your adrenal hormones are off balance, then they'll probably prescribe some hormone medication to regulate your adrenal function.[10]\n",
            "Leave lung nodules alone if they aren't causing any problems.\n",
            "Nodules in your lung, as long as they aren't cancerous, usually don't cause any problems. You probably won't even notice they're there, and doctors usually discover them during routine CT scans. It's best to leave these nodules alone and simply observe them to see if they grow.[11]If nodules cause any breathing trouble, then your doctor will probably suggest a surgical removal.\n",
            "Shrink cancerous nodules with alcohol injections.\n",
            "This treatment, called alcohol ablation, is a potential treatment for small cancerous nodules. The doctor will inject a small amount of alcohol into the nodule to kill any cancer cells. This might help you avoid surgery for smaller nodules.[12]Alcohol ablation requires several treatment sessions, so make sure you stick with the recommended schedule for the best results.\n",
            "Remove large or cancerous nodule with surgery.\n",
            "If the nodule is causing problems or is cancerous, then the doctor will probably want it surgically removed. This is often a simple, minimally-invasive surgery, depending on where the nodule is. By removing the nodule, you should avoid any risk of it spreading.[13]After the surgery, you may need further cancer treatment.If you have a nodule on your thyroid removed, they surgeon may also take out part of the thyroid.

            "To inject a microchip you will need:A microchip scanner: Microchips are not completely standardized. This means that not all chips respond to the same frequency scanner. You need a scanner that is compatible with the make of microchip about to be implanted. Whereas Europe mainly uses chips that are \"duplex\" compatible, in the US mainly \"AVID\" and \"destron\" devices are used.A microchip: This should be sealed in sterile packaging. The chips come with an individual, single use implantation syringe. If the packaging is breached do not use the device because sterility may be compromised.An assistant: In a docile, compliant dog or cat, or an animal under anesthetic, it is perfectly easy to implant a chip single-handedly. However, the needle causes momentary discomfort and many animals flinch. An assistant restraining the patient ensures the procedure is safe and makes implantation quick and easy.Cotton wool soaked in surgical spirit: To sterilize the skin.The animal: The animal to be chipped.\n",

This is to check the pet isn't already microchipped.If a chip is found this eliminates the need to go through with the procedure. In addition, it should raise questions about why the pet is being presented for a chip when it is likely he already has an owner.To check for a chip it is necessary to pass the scanner over the animal in a logical search pattern to ensure a chip that has slipped or migrated from its original implant position is not missed.\n",
            "Follow the correct scanning pattern.\n",
            "Microchips are implanted under the skin, over the midline of the spine, between the shoulder blades. However, not all chips remain in this spot and movements of the animal during normal activities can cause the chip to migrate and change location.Activate the scanner by pressing and holding down the button. Rest the sensor on the underside of the scanner softly against the animal's fur, or hover 12 inches (2.55.1cm) above the skin.Start with the scanner positioned behind the pet's ears and move left to right, right to left, in a sweeping motion over the animal's neck. Progress in this side to side sweeping motion down the neck, over the shoulders, and to the end of the rib cage.\n",

The chip is stored inside a sterile hypodermic needle attached to an implantation device.The needle should be inside sealed packaging. On the packaging are stickers with a bar-code and a unique registration number.Pass the scanner over the needle (while it's still in the packaging) to check the chip is firing, and to get the chip's number. Compare the scanned number with that shown on the packaging. The two should match.Peel the backing from the packaging but leave the implantation device resting in the pack. Place it within reach.\n",

            "Although the implantation needle is sterile, there is a small risk of pushing bacteria from the surface of the skin into the subcutaneous tissues when the needle is inserted. To prevent this, it is best to swab the area first with surgical spirits.To do this, you should first plan where to place the needle. This is usually midline over the backbone, between the shoulder blades.Soak a cotton ball with surgical spirits and wipe this over the skin until the fur is well dampened down.\n",
            "Lift the scruff.\n",
            "The chip needs to be implanted beneath the skin and to do this without damaging muscle, tendons, or bones, the scruff is raised up.If you are right handed, use your left hand to grasp a fold of skin two inches in front of where you plan to place the needle.Holding the skin firmly between forefinger and thumb, lift this fold of skin vertically away from the body, to the fullest extent the skin comfortably allows without pulling.\n",
            "Inject the microchip.\n",
            "With the scruff still elevated, pick up the installation device and place the needle at a right angle to the flat plain of the elevated scruff.Hold the device so that the length of the syringe is parallel to the spine and the needle is pointing towards the head. Once satisfied with the needle location, use firm pressure to push the needle through the skin right up to the needle hub.With the needle deeply embedded through the skin, press the plunger of the implantation device to push the microchip out of the needle and into position beneath the skin.\n",
            "Withdraw the needle.\n",
            "When the needle is withdrawn from the skin, the needle tract does not contract instantaneously. As a result, there is a slim chance that the microchip slips back out of this tract immediately after implantation.This is easily avoided by applying pressure across the needle as it is withdrawn. This pressure sticks the edges of the needle tract together and prevents backward migration of the chip.To do this, once the microchip is implanted, release the scruff. Using the finger and thumb of the left hand, feel through the skin for the rigid needle.Press gently but firmly across the width of the needle as the right hand withdraws it. Keep pressing for 10 seconds or longer, after the needle is out. Then release.\n",
            "Check the chip.\n",
            "The final step is to check that the chip is in place and working. Activate the scanner and hold it over the area of implantation. If all has gone well, the chip should register strongly on the scanner.Occasionally the chip does not respond, but because you know the chip worked in the packaging, it is unlikely that the chip is at fault.The more likely explanation is that the chip failed to exit the needle (scan the needle) or has fallen out on the floor. If this is the case, you will need to repeat the procedure with a fresh chip.\n",

            "Find a quadcopter design in a book or online for reference.\n",
            "There are many websites and books devoted specifically to building your own drone. The most common kind of home-built drone tends to start with an X shape that allows you to mount 4 rotors (called a quadcopter). This design is easy to build and is used even on high-end drones. Having a design to follow will help make it easier to decide where best to place each component.Once you've finished a quadcopter drone, you can try larger designs that incorporate more motors to carry more equipment like cameras.Many drone designs are available for free online if you search DIY drone design.\n",
            "Make a frame for the drone out of metal, plastic, or wood.\n",
            "Begin constructing your frame using the material of your choice. Model plastic, balsa wood, or thin metal (thinner than .25 inches (0.64cm)) are best. For a simple quadcopter design, lay one 12in (30cm) long piece of wood, plastic or light metal across another, so it creates an X shape with 90-degree angles. Each extending arm of the drone frame should reach toward what would be the corner of a perfect square you could draw around the frame. Choose a frame material that is at least 1 inch (2.5cm) wide to support mounting your engines.[1]You can purchase model plastic, thin metal, or balsa wood at most hobby or model stores. You can also find these materials at drone retailers or on websites like Amazon.Use glue or duct tape to secure the two pieces of your frame together.Don't move on to the next step until the pieces of the frame are secure and any glue you've used has dried.\n",
            "Purchase motors, propellers and other electronics from a drone retailer.\n",
            "There are some components of your drone that can't be built from scratch, so you'll need to purchase them. If there is no drone retailer nearby, many hobby stores that carry model rockets and R/C airplanes will carry them.[2]You will need to purchase speed controllers, a power distribution board, and a flight controller along with the motors and propellers. Note that most modern flight controller comes integrated with power distribution board.If you have trouble finding the parts you need, many drone specific online retailers, as well as large retailers like Amazon, carry these parts.Drone engines should be rated to produce a total of twice as much thrust as the drone weighs. If your quadcopter will weigh 800 grams (28oz), each engine should produce 400 grams (14oz) so the combined total amount of thrust will equal 1,600 grams (56oz).Make sure the speed controller current rating is higher than that of your motor.You can often buy these components in bundles.\n",
            "Drill holes in the frame to support the motors.\n",
            "Most motors mount using anywhere from 2 to 4 screws. Place one motor at the end of one of the drone's extended arms and make marks where the holes need to be drilled. Then use those holes to guide you when using the drill. If you are using self-setting wood screws on a wood or plastic frame, drill the holes smaller than the diameter of the screws so they can work as a guide.If you are using metal, drill holes of the same diameter of the mounting bolts you'll use. You will then need to use nuts on the underside of the bolts to secure them in place.\n",
            "Cut 4 .5in (1.3cm) rings from a 4in (10cm) PVC pipe to make landing gear.\n",
            "Lay the pipe on its side and mark it where you'll make your cut. Then use a saw to cut all four sections, so you're left with 4 plastic rings made of PVC pipe. These four rings will serve as lightweight landing gear for your drone.The cuts don't have to be perfect as long as the rings are thick enough to be sturdy, but the better the finish on your cuts, the better the drone will look.\n",
            "Stand the landing gear rings on their side and attach them with duct tape.\n",
            "Place one ring on its side beneath each arm of the drone's frame, then use thin strips of duct tape to secure the rings to the arms. The drone will now stand on its own on your table. You can use glue instead of tape, but make sure it's completely dry before moving on.Keep the rings in the middle of the arms so they don't interfere with the placement of your motors or other components.\n",
            "Mount the motors on the frame.\n",
            "Place each motor over the holes you drilled for them and then use screws or bolts to secure them in place. Then slide the propellers over the posts extending from the top of the motors and screw the caps that came with the motors over the top of the posts.[3]The drone frame now has landing gear and motors, but the center portion of the frame should still be empty.Tighten the bolts or screws securely so the motors can't wiggle at all on the frame. Any slack will create vibrations that can make the drone unstable.\n",
            "Use zip ties to secure the speed controllers to the bottom of the frame.\n",
            "The electronic speed controllers that connect to the motors should be mounted on the underside of the drone frame to prevent it from getting too top heavy when you add the rest of the components. Zip ties are an easy way to attach them. Run the zip ties through the mounting loops on the speed controllers (or just across them) and over the frame. Then pull the zip ties tight so the controllers are firmly held in place.[4]Don't use glue the first time you assemble your drone, as you may find you want to adjust the positioning of different components based on how it flies.The speed controllers regulate how fast the motors on the drone spin. This ensures all four motors spin at the same speed so the drone will be level as it flies.\n",
            "Secure the battery to the frame.\n",
            "Consider the size and shape of your battery when looking for the right place to mount it. If it's flat, you can mount it in the center of the drone and then mount other components on top of it. If not, you may want to mount the battery on the underside of the drone along with the speed controllers.[5]In most applications, mounting the battery in the center of the top of the frame is the best place.Use zip ties to hold the battery in place so you can remove it and move it if you need to adjust the weight distribution of the drone later.\n",
            "Install the power distribution board.\n",
            "Center the power distribution board on the drone frame, on top of the battery if you placed it there as well. Connect the lines from the speed controllers and the battery to the board once you've zip tied it down.[6]The power distribution board relays the right amount of power to each component to keep the drone operating smoothly.\n",
            "Attach the flight controller to the drone frame with zip ties and connect it.\n",
            "The flight controller relays information from the remote control to the power distribution board. Position it on top of the power distribution board and then zip tie it down. Refer to the instructions for the flight controller and power distribution box to connect them properly, but in most applications, the connection will be one clearly marked wire that plugs directly from one into the other.\n",
            "Buy a wireless remote control system that works with your flight controller.\n",
            "Ask for help at your local hobby store or drone retailer to make sure to choose a remote control system that works with your specific flight controller. Often, you can buy them in bundles, but if not, the remote control system will list the flight controller systems it is compatible with on the box. Choose one that lists your flight controller.[7]The remote control system will come with the remote control itself that you'll use to pilot your drone.Check to see if your system takes off-the-shelf batteries or is rechargeable. You'll need to power it to connect it to your flight control system.\n",
            "Connect the motors to the speed controllers.\n",
            "Run the wires from the motors to their respective speed controllers on the underside of the drone's frame so power can be transferred into the motors once you power the drone up. While these connections may vary from brand to brand, they are usually a simple male/female connection that just needs to be pressed together.[8]If your components don't have a simple connector, refer to the instruction manual for the speed controller to assess the best way to connect them.You may need to solder the wire directly to a port on the motor itself. If so, check the manual for the motor as well, to ensure you're soldering the wire to the correct port.\n",
            "Charge the drone battery.\n",
            "Use the power supply that came with your battery to plug it into a wall outlet. Leave it plugged in until it reaches a maximum charge (usually four hours, but refer to the instructions that came with your battery to check for your specific application). You'll need the drone's flight controller powered to connect it to the remote control system.Many drone operators choose to purchase and charge multiple batteries, as each one will only power the drone in flight for a few minutes before needing to be recharged again.\n",
            "Link the remote control system to the flight controller.\n",
            "Follow the instructions that came with your remote control system to establish a link between the remote control and the flight controller mounted on the drone. On many applications, this connection is easy to establish: simply hold the sync button on both the remote control and the flight controller while they're near each other and the two will link up.\n",
            "Fly your drone\n",
            "in the air. Turn on both the drone (using the switch on the flight controller) and the radio control. Drone controls usually have at least two joysticks: the left stick controls the yaw (or the direction the drone is pointed) by moving left to right, and the throttle by going forward and backward. The right stick controls the roll (left to right) and the pitch (pointing the nose down or up).[9]Use the left stick to control speed and direction.Use the right stick to control the orientation of the drone (leaning left or right, angled up or down).\n",

            "Learn the two different types of beans.\n",
            "In general, there are two overall types of beans: shell beans and snap beans. Both types can grow in either the pole- or bush-style, but the pods of the beans are what make them unique. Shell beans are primarily removed from their pod to be eaten, and are consumed fresh or dried to save for later. Snap beans are eaten inside their pod, and are only eaten fresh (not dried for later use). You can grow multiple styles of these beans directly adjacent to one another, because bean plants are self-pollinating and wont cross-contaminate each other.Popular shell beans include black beans, fava beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans.Popular snap beans include snap (green) beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, asparagus beans, and scarlet-runner beans.\n",
            "Consider growing a pole-bean variety.\n",
            "Pole beans are a type of beans that are vining and must be supported with a trellis or pole. Pole beans grow an average of 5- to 6-feet tall, and can grow either shell or snap bean. Pole beans generally thrive in cooler summer temperatures, as low as 50F (10C) in the summer. In the US, they thrive in the northern states.You can use whatever support system (trellis, pole, fence, arbor, etc.) that you want for pole beans.\n",
            "Consider growing a bush-bean variety.\n",
            "Bush beans are a type of beans that grow in off a bush, and do not need a trellis or pole for support. Generally, bush beans grow best in warm environments with summer temperatures reaching above 100F (38C). In the US, they thrive in the Southern states. Bush beans should be planted in large rows, requiring much more space than pole beans.A variety of bush beans called half-runners is a bush/pole hybrid, and may require some support or placement near a fence for stabilization.\n",
            "Choose your garden plot.\n",
            "Beans are flexible plants, able to grow in both sun and shade. When possible, choose a garden plot in most or partial sunlight. Because pole beans grow primarily upwards, you need only a small space for them. Bush beans grow outwards, meaning that they require much more space; choose a plot 23 feet (0.60.9m) wide and as long as you desire (for the total number of beans you wish to plant).\n",
            "Know when to plant.\n",
            "Beans should be planted after the last frost has passed, typically in the spring months of March and April. Planting too early in the season will cause the seeds to freeze and die, while planting too late may not give them enough time to mature for a harvest in the fall. Check with your local agricultural extension to find out the best planting time for your area.\n",
            "Know how to plant.\n",
            "Beans are one of the few plants that should not be started as seedlings indoors or transplanted into your garden. This is because they have a delicate root structure that is easily damaged, and may not survive the transfer. As a result, you should sow your seeds directly into the ground come spring.[1]\n",
            "Prepare your soil.\n",
            "Beans grow best in soil with good drainage and lots of nutrients. To prepare your soil, mix in a garden compost and gardening topsoil into your garden plot. Use a hoe to till the soil thoroughly and break apart any clay-like chunks. Incorporating the compost into the soil will help to provide plenty of nutrients to help the beans grow.Beans are nitrogen fixing, meaning they can pull nitrogen from the air and add fertility to the soil. They do this in symbiosis with bacteria. If you have not previously grown beans on your plot, consider adding a bacterial inoculant. You can dust your seeds with it, or add some to each hole when planting.[2]\n",
            "Set up your trellis.\n",
            "If youre planting pole beans, you will need to put your trellis in the ground prior to planting the beans. Place the trellis, stake, or pole in the exact area you plan to plant. As the beans grow, they will naturally wind themselves around the structure for support. Dig a hole deep enough to stabilize the trellis/pole, should there be bad weather or heavy winds.\n",
            "Dig a hole.\n",
            "Pole beans should be planted so that there is one seed per hole, and each seed is at least 3 inches (7.6cm) away from the next. Bush beans should be planted so that there is one seed per hole, and each seed is at least 2 inches (5.1cm) away from the next. The hole should be 1-inch deep.[3]Remember that bush beans need more space in between plants than pole bean as pole beans grow vertically.\n",
            "Place the seeds.\n",
            "Carefully put one seed in each hole youve dug; it may be tempting to put multiple seeds at once, but this will cause the seedlings to compete for space and nutrients as they grow, and possibly result in the death of the plant. Cover up each seed with 12 inches (2.55.1cm) of your garden soil.\n",
            "Water your seeds regularly.\n",
            "Immediately after planting, give your seeds plenty of water to aid in their germination. After planting, you should continue to water the seeds once every 2-3 days, so that the soil is always moist. Avoid over watering though, as too much water (leaving puddles or pools on the topsoil) will cause the seeds to rot.\n",
            "Put down a layer of mulch after the seeds sprout.\n",
            "Mulch is an incredibly helpful tool for new gardeners. Made from trees, leaves, or straw, mulch is a layer of shredded plant limbs you place over the topsoil in your garden. This blocks out weeds and traps in moisture, two good things for new plants. Spread a layer of mulch 1-inch thick over your garden soil after your seeds have grown several inches tall.\n",
            "Fertilize your garden every four weeks.\n",
            "Fertilizer adds nutrients to garden soil, helping increase the growth of your beans and the overall harvest. Fertilizers are made of a combination of three primary ingredients: nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Beans naturally produce a lot of nitrogen, meaning that you should look for a fertilizer that has low nitrogen content (such as a 5-20-20 mixture). Ask your local nursery worker with help on choosing a fertilizer for your beans, if you have questions.[4]Do not add nitrogen fertilizer to the soil if you added a nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria will help the plants make their own.\n",
            "Pick bean pods before the shapes of the beans show through.\n",
            "If you want to eat your beans fresh, you should pick your beans when the pods are large and full. The pods should not yet show the shape of the beans, because by that stage they have begun to dry out. Harvest the pods by snapping them off at the top; dont tear them, as this can damage the plant and prevent new pods from sprouting.If you harvest at the right time, your bean plants could continue to produce new pods for several weeks.\n",
            "Dry your beans on the plant.\n",
            "If you want to dry your shell beans for later use, the process is easy: leave your beans on the plant until they are completely dry. This process usually takes 1-2 months after having reached peak ripeness. You can tell when the beans are totally dry and ready for storage, as they will rattle inside the pods.[5]\n",
            "Freeze beans for later use.\n",
            "Fresh beans can be frozen and used later, if you dont want them fresh but dont want to dry them. Simply place them in an airtight container and put them in your freezer. They will remain good for 6-9 months after initially being placed in the freezer; thaw them by letting them rise to room temperature.\n",

            "Find the negative cable, which will be marked with a minus sign (-) and may have a black cover over it. Remove the cover, if applicable, and use a wrench to unbolt the negative cable from the terminal.[3]Be sure to use the negative, not the positive, cable to test for the draw to prevent electrical shorts!Generally, a 10-mm open-ended wrench is the tool you'll need to remove the cable.\n",
            "Set up a digital multimeter.\n",
            "The multimeter has both a black wire and a red wire attached to it as well as several different input slots. Connect the black wire to the \"com\" (common ground) input and plug the red wire into the highest amp input (usually 20A). Set the dial on the multimeter to measure amps.[4][5]Choose a digital meter than can read up to 20 amps and down to 200 milliamps.[6]\n",
            "Attach the multimeter to the negative battery cable and terminal.\n",
            "Place the red lead through the metal circle at the end of the negative battery cable. Touch the black lead to the negative battery terminal.[7]You can use plastic clamps to secure the leads in place so your hands are free and the meter continues to operate.\n",
            "Note that you have a parasitic draw if the reading is more than 50 milliamps.\n",
            "There are a few things that constantly draw power in a vehicle, such as the clock on the radio, so its normal to have a reading between 20 and 50 milliamps. If your reading is higher than that, it means theres a draw and something is using too much power.[8]\n",
            "Pull out the fuses one at a time while watching the multimeter reading.\n",
            "Locate the fuse box under the hood. Use a fuse puller to remove the fuses, starting with the ones with the smallest amp ratings and working toward the ones with the highest amp ratings. After you pull a fuse, check the multimeter to see if the reading changes. If it doesnt, replace the fuse and move onto the next one.[9]Once youve worked through all of the fuses in the fuse box under the hood, check the fuses in the fuse box(es) under the dash. Its best if you have a friend help you with this so one person can pull fuses while the other person watches the reading on the multimeter. If you dont have anyone to help, prop the meter against the windshield so you can read it from inside the vehicle.\n",
            "Stop when pulling a fuse makes the reading drop significantly.\n",
            "Removing a fuse may cause the multimeter reading to drop a few milliamps, which is normal. What youre looking for is a significant drop, such as if the reading goes from 3.03 amps to 0.03 amps. When this happens, youve found the electrical circuit thats creating the parasitic draw![10]\n",

            "Consult the chart on the fuse box and/or the owners' manual to find out what components are powered by the fuse thats causing the drain. You can also check the wiring diagram for the particular circuit to help you narrow down the problem.[11]Usually, you can find digital copies of the manual and wiring diagrams online.\n",
            "Check each device or component on that circuit.\n",
            "Replace the fuse and disconnect each lamp, heater, or electrical device one at a time. Flip all of the switches that correspond to the components as well. Watch for the reading on the multimeter to drop to find out which component is causing the drain.[12]For instance, say the offending fuse controls the power antenna as well as the radio. Unplug the radio and see if the draw goes away. If it doesnt, unplug the antenna and watch for the reading on the multimeter to drop.\n",
            "Repair the component causing the draw, disconnect the multimeter, and reconnect the battery.\n",
            "The repair process will vary widely depending on what the problem is, so if youre not sure how to fix the component, hire a certified mechanic to make the repair or replacement. If you can make the repair yourself, check it by ensuring the reading on the multimeter is less than 50 milliamps. Once youre done, disconnect the multimeter and reconnect the battery cable.You may be able to simply flip a switch into the \"off\" position to eliminate the draw, or you might be facing a more complex problem, such as an issue with a wiring harness.\n",

            "Puppies are cute and furry, but require a lot more time, attention, and money than you may think. It would not be fair to you or your puppy to bring him home when you are not truly ready for, or committed to, caring for him. Asking yourself a few questionsand answering them honestlywill help you determine if you are ready to take on the responsibility of buying a puppy.Do I have the time groom, train, and exercise my puppy? Puppies are very time-intensivealthough some breeds are more laid back than others, you will need to devote a lot of time to properly caring for your puppy. If you have a busy schedule or are out of town a lot, you may need to reconsider if you will be able to make time to take care of a puppy.Am I financially able to cover the costs of caring for a puppy? Theres no getting around the fact that puppies are expensive. Think about if you are ready to pay for all of the necessities (food, collar, toys, bedding, etc.) plus regular and unexpected veterinary visits.Is anyone at my house allergic to dogs?[1] If you do not live alone, you should consider whether anyone else who lives with you is allergic to dogs or pet dander in general.\n",
            "Decide what breed is a good fit for you.\n",
            "[2] Research breeds with characteristics (e.g., small dog, calm temperament, etc.) that make them a good fit for your life situation. The AKC has a matching quiz that can help you choose a breed.  Dogs come in all shapes, sizes and personalities. Choosing the wrong breed can result in heartbreak for all if you realize that he is not a good fit for your home. A few examples of important factors to keep in mind include your living situation (apartment vs home) and work schedule (regular work hours vs constant travel).Consider the energy level of the breed. For example, if you don't enjoy being outdoors much, getting a Siberian husky probably isn't the best idea. Huskies love to jump and run, and they need hours of daily exercise. It may be better to choose a puppy who will grow up to be a dog that likes napping and hanging out with you at home, such as a Cavalier King Charles.If you rent, your apartment may have breed and weight restrictions for dogs. In addition, a large dog who needs a lot of exercise, such as a Golden Retriever, may feel a bit stifled in an apartment. If your apartment complex allows larger dogs, you will need to make sure that you have easy access to a large fenced-in area or dog park where you dog will be able run and exercise.Talking to a reputable breeder could help you narrow down which breed would be an ideal fit for your life situation.Other than doing Internet searches of dog breeds, consider purchasing a book on dog breeds.Keep in mind that you do not have to pick a specific breed. A mutt will do just fine!\n",
            "Create a budget for puppy-related expenses.\n",
            "Aside from the initial cost of purchasing the puppy, factor in how much you will need to spend on food, toys, cleaning and grooming supplies, and veterinary care.[3] By creating a budget, you will have a more realistic expectation of the monthly costs associated with having a puppy at home.[4]Depending on the breed and size, buying a puppy could cost between $100 and $150 per month in the first year.[5]Do not forget to factor in costs of smaller items, such as collars, leashes, identification tags, and treats.Purchasing a puppy from a breeder will likely be more expensive than adopting a puppy from a shelter.\n",
            "Puppy-proof your home.\n",
            "Chances are that your home is not ready for a puppy. Similar to making a home safe for children, you will need to make your home safe for your puppy. For example, keep your trash cans hidden or well out of reach. You may need to invest in child-proof latches if your puppy figures out how to open cupboards.[6]Place covers over electrical outlets so that your puppy cannot lick them.[7]Keep all medications, cleaning supplies, and antifreeze hidden and out of reach. These can all be toxic to your puppy.[8]If you have a garage, secure heavy tools to the wall. Make sure to pick up any loose screws that your puppy could easily eat off the garage floor.[9]\n",
            "Choose a veterinarian.\n",
            "You will likely be taking to your puppy to the veterinarian fairly regularly during his first year of life, and at least once a year after that. It will be important for you to find a veterinarian that you feel comfortable with.[10] Rather than doing an online search of local veterinary offices, you may want to seek recommendations of good veterinarians from local breeders, other dog owners, or your local pet store.\n",
            "Search online for the breed you want.\n",
            "If you have a particular breed in mind, look online to find out which shelters currently have adoptable puppies. Online resources like Petfinder.org provide listings of puppies and dogs from hundreds of shelters. You can search by breed, size, gender, and age to find the right puppy for you, then contact the shelter directly to proceed with the adoption.[11]You may have to travel out of your city to get a particular breed. Consider expanding your search to include shelters within a few hundred miles of your home for best results.Some rare or expensive breeds may not be available in shelters. However, there are breed-specific rescue groups that may have the breed (or designer breed, such as a Labradoodle) that you are looking for.Animal shelters and rescue groups often conduct behavioral tests (also known as temperament tests) to determine if a puppy is a good candidate for adoption.Even with the additional costs of spaying/neutering, microchipping, vaccinating, and deworming, adopting a puppy from an animal shelter or rescue is usually less expensive than going through a breeder or paying for all of these services separately.\n",
            "Visit shelters in your area.\n",
            "If you are not as particular about what type of breed you want, consider going to a shelter to meet puppies in person.[12] When you are the shelter, ask questions about the puppies history and behavior. Also, try to observe the activities at the shelter to determine if the dogs are well taken care of.Animal shelters can be stressful environments for dogs because of the noise, number of dogs, and high level of general activity. Some dogs may develop behavioral problems while at the shelter. The staff at the shelter should inform you if the puppy you are interested in has any behavioral issues.\n",
            "Ask questions at the animal shelter.\n",
            "Asking questions at an animal shelter is just as important as asking a breeder questions. For example, you will want to ask about where the animals came from (e.g., stray, given up by previous owner). It would also be helpful to learn how long the puppy that you are interested in has been at the shelter.Ask questions about the puppy's medical history and how his behavior has been at the shelter. His behavior at the shelter may be different than what it could be at your home.Ask about the shelter's procedure for pets who get sick shortly after they are adopted. Because of a shelter's limited budget for veterinary care, be aware that you may responsible for a majority, if not all, of your puppy's medical expenses after you adopt him.You can also ask if the shelter is a \"no-kill\" shelter. This type of shelter does not euthanize animals after they have been at the shelter for a certain amount of time.\n",
            "Learn about the adoption process.\n",
            "Be aware that you may not be able to adopt a puppy on the same day that you go to the animal shelter or rescue group. Commonly, there will be an interview process in which the staff will give you the full history and medical background of the puppy.[13] There may also be a home visit where a member of the staff will visit your home to determine if your home environment is suitable for the puppy.Dont be surprised if you are interviewed as well. The staff will need assurance that you will be a responsible pet owner and take good care of your puppy.In addition to the interview and potential home visit, you will need to fill out the necessary paperwork and pay the adoption fee (usually $100 to $200).\n",
            "Do not get discouraged.\n",
            "The animal shelters or rescue groups in your area may not have the exact breed that you want. Fortunately, they tend to have a high turnover of animals, so it may not be long before the perfect puppy for you is at the animal shelter or rescue group. Check back with them regularly to learn what breeds of dogs they have acquired.[14]\n",
            "Learn about the different types of breeders.\n",
            "Not all breeders are reputable, so you will want to know which ones to consider and which ones to avoid if you want to buy a puppy through a breeder. One type of breeder is a hobby show breeder. Hobby show breeders are highly knowledgeable about a dog breed and invest considerable time and energy into selecting an optimal pedigree and raising show quality puppies. These breeders will typically raise only one or two litters per year.Backyard breeders typically have very little knowledge about dog breeds and are probably just trying to make a little money on the side. Avoid buying a puppy from a backyard breeder.Commercial breeders typically house several different dog breeds and produce numerous litters in a year. The physical environment of a commercial breeder may or may not be of good quality. In addition, not all commercial breeders produce AKC registration papers. Puppies that you see in pet stores may come from commercial breeders.\n",
            "Identify a responsible breeder.\n",
            "[15] Check with local veterinarians and dog breed organizations to find a breeder with a reputation for taking good care of his or her dogs. He or she should breed just a few types of dogs and have a strong relationship with local veterinarians and other animal organizations. The ASPCA has a helpful list of responsible breeders.[16]A responsible breeder will ask you questions about why you want a dog, who will be taking care of it and where it will live. He or she will not simply take your cash and hand over a puppy.\n",
            "Visit the breeders location.\n",
            "You should never purchase a puppy through a breeder without having visited the breeders location. It is very important that you see where your puppy, his littermates, and his parents were housed and raised.[17] A responsible breeder will actually encourage you to visit multiple times so that you completely comfortable with his or her physical location and business practices.\n",
            "Ask the breeder plenty of questions.\n",
            "Buying a puppy through a breeder can be very expensive, so you want to be sure that the breeder is honest, knowledgeable, and ethical. There are many questions that you can ask the breeder: How are the puppies raised and socialized? How do you screen potential puppy buyers? What is your procedure during whelping (birthing process)? Have the parents been tested for breed-specific diseases?[18]You can ask other questions regarding how many puppies were in the litter and what medical care they have received (vaccinating, deworming, etc.).[19]Ask for documentation regarding medical care, microchipping, and screening for breed-specific behavioral or medical issues.[20]Dont be afraid to ask questions. If the breeder is reputable, he or she will have no problem answering any and all questions that you have about them and the dogs he or she breeds and raises.Be ready to answer questions as to why you want a puppy and how you plan to take care of it. A good breeder will be very concerned about the welfare of the puppies he or she has bred. Forming a good relationship with a breeder can be very helpful if you have questions later in the puppy's life, or if you are interested in showing the puppy later.\n",
            "Obtain American Kennel Club (AKC) paperwork.\n",
            "You will also need to obtain a contract of sale. If you are interested in showing or breeding the puppy you buy, you will need proof that he is registered with the AKC and that you are the legal owner.[21] Be aware, though, that AKC papers tell you who your puppys parents are and are not proof that your puppy was raised properly by the breeder.Be wary of a breeder who tries to sell you a puppy since simply because he or she has papers showing the puppys lineage.\n",
            "Stay away from puppy mills!\n",
            "Puppy mills are notorious for mass breeding of puppies in deplorable conditions. Breeders who run puppy mills are typically more concerned with making a profit than practicing responsible breeding practices.[22] Puppies bred in this type of environment may have genetic abnormalities that could lead to physical and emotional disorders that, unfortunately, you wont discover right away.When you visit a breeder, take a close look at the conditions. If the dogs there look dirty, skinny or unhealthy, do not purchase a puppy there.If a breeder is reluctant to show you his or her entire premises, it is probable that he or she is running a puppy mill and does not want you to see the poor conditions in which the dogs are being bred and raised.[23]If a breeder does not ask you a lot of questions and takes a hands-off approach to the puppy's care after he or she has sold it, you should suspect that he or she is running a puppy mill.[24]Breeders who claim to breed a large number of purebreds or \"designer\" breeds are likely not telling you the truth and are probably running a puppy mill.[25] The dogs are most likely  not  purebred or a designer breed.You might want to report a puppy mill to the authorities. You can fill out a report at http://www.humanesociety.org/forms/report_a_puppy_mill.html or call 1-877-MILL-TIP if you suspect a breeder you visit is harming dogs and puppies.\n",

            "Puppies in pet stores can come from puppy mills. Do your due diligenceask the staff at the pet store where they obtain their puppies and research the breeders that they mention. If you are going to buy a puppy from a pet store, you should be confident the puppies come from reputable animal shelters and/or breeders.\n",
            "Physically exam the puppy.\n",
            "Puppies are ready to be adopted between eight and twelve weeks of age, at which time they are weaned from their mothers, able to eat solid food, and have received the first round of vaccinations.[26] A puppy may look healthy at first glance but, upon closer inspection, may have some physical abnormalities. If you see signs that the puppy is not in good health, you may need to reconsider adopting the puppy. A good way to physically exam a puppy is start at the head and work your way to the tail.[27]There are many aspects of a puppys physical appearance to examine. If you are not sure that you can do a thorough examination, consider asking the breeder or staff at the animal shelter or rescue group to guide you through the process.Examine the puppys head. For example, the nose should be cool and wet with no discharge. The gums should be a healthy pink color. Also, the eyes should look clear and bright and have a dark pupil. The ears should be clean and positioned according to specific breed characteristics.[28]Put your hand on the puppys chest to feel the heartbeat. An abnormal heartbeat could indicate a genetic heart defect which could require veterinary care.[29]Examine the puppys coat. If he is purebred, his coat should match the breed standard. In general, the puppys hair should be shiny and smooth without areas of hair loss.[30]Look at the puppys legs. His legs should be straight without structural deformities (e.g., legs that bow in or out). You may want a breeder or veterinarian to do a more detailed orthopedic examination of the puppy.[31]\n",
            "Observe the puppy's temperament.\n",
            "Whether you're getting your puppy from a shelter or a breeder, take time to assess the puppy's personality before you make your decision. For example, watch a litter of puppies and see how they play together. Puppies in the same litter usually have different personalities, and you'll want to pick the one that will make the best pet for you.Puppies with a good combination of energy and sweetness make the best pets.[32] Look for a puppy that's playful and energetic, but not too rough with the others.Avoid picking a puppy that seems overly aggressive or extremely shy.\n",
            "Play with the puppy to see if he is a good fit.\n",
            "Make sure you have a good connection with the puppy you have chosen before you seal the deal. If the puppy shies away or tucks his tail between his legs when you approach, he may not have the best temperament to become a pet. If you like the puppy's personality but aren't sure how he'll get along with your children or other pets, you may be able to foster the puppy to help you decide.[33]Keep in mind that puppies also choose their owners. The puppy you are interested in will probably be paying attention to you see if he is comfortable around you.\n",

            "Visit a local shoe store or browse online to find a pair of stretchers with good reviews. Plan to spend about $20 for plastic stretchers or closer to $40 for wooden ones.[1]Most stretchers come in pairs of 2. If youre buying ones sold individually, consider buying 2. That way, you wont have to wait 12 hours for the first boot to finish stretching before you can move on to the second one.Wooden stretchers are more durable, but plastic ones work just as well and usually take up less storage space.Pay attention to the length of the stretcher compared to the length of your boots and make sure to purchase stretchers that are long enough.\n",
            "Slide the unexpanded calf stretchers into each boot.\n",
            "Position the stretchers so that the narrower end goes into the boot first. Push the calf stretchers down until they are just past the ankle into the actual body of the boot. This ensures the entire calf will get stretched evenly.[2]Keeping the stretchers unexpanded at this stage helps you get them into the boots completely.\n",
            "Twist the handle to expand the stretchers until the leather is pulled taut.\n",
            "As you twist the handle, youll notice the leather getting tighter and tighter as the stretchers push against the material. Keep twisting until you can visibly see the leather straining against the stretchers.[3]With time, you should be able to expand the calves of your leather boots by about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8cm).\n",
            "Let the stretchers do their work for about 12 hours.\n",
            "Stretching leather takes some time, so start the process well before youll need to wear your boots. It wont hurt the boots if you leave the stretchers in for longer than 12 hours.[4]If you stretch the boots for just a few hours, the leather will most likely shrink back down to its original size.\n",
            "Repeat the stretching process until youve achieved the desired fit.\n",
            "After the initial 12 hours have passed, remove the stretchers and try on your boots. If theyre still a little too tight, stretch them again for an additional 12 hours, this time expanding the stretchers just a little bit further.[5]If you find your boots are still too tight after 2-3 sessions, you could try taking them to a cobbler to see if they can expand them a bit further.\n",
            "Mix 1 cup (240mL) each of water and rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle.\n",
            "The rubbing alcohol loosens the leather, which allows it to expand and stretch. Diluting the rubbing alcohol with water keeps it from evaporating too quickly.[6]You could also purchase a leather-stretching spray from a shoe store or online for similar results. Most products are in the $10-$20 range.\n",
            "Spray the inside of the boot calves until theyre saturated with the mix.\n",
            "Wipe away any spray that ends up on the outside of the boots; the rubbing alcohol could potentially discolor the leather. Try flipping the boots upside down if youre having a hard time getting the bottom half of the calves wet.[7]If needed, make more of the alcohol and water solution.\n",
            "Put on the boots and wear them for about 30 minutes until they dry.\n",
            "After youve sprayed the insides, put the boots on immediately. This should help the leather conform to the exact size of your calves as they dry.[8]If you hate the idea of wearing wet boots, use boot-calf stretchers in conjunction with the spray instead.\n",
            "Rub a leather-conditioning cream on the exterior of your boots.\n",
            "The application of water to your boots increases the risk that they could dry out and crack. If you rub the exterior with a conditioning cream, itll help keep the leather supple.[9]You can apply the conditioning cream while youre wearing the drying boots, or you could wait until youve taken them off again. The conditioning cream will work either way.\n",
            "Repeat the process 2-3 more times until the calves fit comfortably.\n",
            "Respray the inside of the boots with the water and rubbing alcohol solution, wear the boots until they dry, and continue to apply conditioning cream each time. It may take several sessions for the calves to fully stretch to the size you want.If after 2-3 attempts the calves are still too small, consider taking the boots to a cobbler.

If youre going 30mph (48km/h), it will take approximately 2.39 seconds to stop but the distance you travel equals about 66ft (20m). Always apply your brakes to maintain a safe distance between you and any vehicles in front of you.Always stay aware of your surroundings and other traffic so you can brake when you need to.If your bike has an anti-lock braking system (ABS brakes), then your stopping time and distance may be slightly shorter.Your braking distance can also be affected by road conditions.

            "Take the slow approach.\n",
            "Lean in slowly for the kiss to build dramatic anticipation. The more excited you and your partner are for a kiss to commence, the more intense it will be when you finally connect your lips.[1]Start off with small pecks and build up to bigger and more intense kissing. By starting small you can slowly ease into an intimate act with your partner.Take breaks between kissing your partner to look at one another without touching lips. You can leave your hands on your partner's hips, shoulders, or run your hands across your partner's face in smooth caresses. By staring into your partner's eyes, you can show him/her that you are truly absorbed in them as a unique person.[2]\n",
            "Leave the slobbering to your dog.\n",
            "There's nothing worse than a slobbery kiss. Just nothing. Other than making you appear to have no idea what you're doing, nobody wants to have your spit all over their face. Well, maybe just a little bit of spit.[3]Avoid opening your mouth too wide. A wide-mouthed approach can cause you to lose a ridiculous amount of saliva to your partner's precious face.Swallow often. Don't forget to swallow your excess saliva while kissing. Your spit has to go somewhere, just don't make it your partner's face.\n",
            "Keep your lips gently pursed.\n",
            "You want your lips to be in a nice plump purse, but avoid pursing your lips too tightly. If you tighten your lips together too strongly in a protruding kissy face, your lips will lose their plumpness and will not be as luscious for kissing.(Ladies: this is the same kissy face you make when putting on your lipstick!)\n",
            "Tilt your head slightly to one side or the other.\n",
            "Most right-handed people will feel more natural tilting their head to the right, and left-handed people will prefer to tilt left. The important thing is that you and your partner are tilting the same direction (i.e. both to the right or both to the left), which will create a mirror-effect and allow you to lock lips.[4]Transition smoothly between tilting your head to the right and the left. You can make your kissing game more interesting by changing up movements from side to side every few kisses. The transition should come at the end of a kiss and the beginning of another.Don't move your head from side to side too frequently. Doing so can create sloppy rhythm and can become uncomfortable for both people involved.\n",
            "Use your tongue to French kiss\n",
            ". Slowly and lightly sweep your tongue along your partner's lower lip, tongue, and gums. Start off very gently and slowly increase in pressure and pace as your partner starts to return the tongue action.[5]Don't stick your entire tongue in your partner's mouth, you really only need to use about the front third of your tongue. Use quick, sweeping motions and make sure that your tongue is constantly moving. Letting your tongue fall limp in your partner's mouth is not sexy.This is where it can really get slobbery. Make sure to swallow often to avoid allowing too much saliva to build up in your mouth and spill over into your partner's mouth. There is a fine line between sexy and slobbery. Try not to cross it.\n",
            "Break up the kissing with romantic stares.\n",
            "Pull your lips apart every once in a while to put some space between you and your partner and gaze into each other's eyes. Taking a break can make your kissing all the more intense once you reconnect. Plus, there's no better way to show someone you are truly paying attention to them than by staring sweetly into their eyes.\n",
            "Be creative.\n",
            "Try different gentle nibbling/sucking/kissing/tongue combinations to keep it fresh and exciting.Give the \"lip-o-suction\" move a try. Kiss your partner's upper lip while your partner nibbles and sucks on your lower lip, then switch.[6]Interrupt your kissing with small bites and nibbles. A sensual nibble on your partner's bottom lip can break up with rhythm of lip kissing in a good way. Be careful not to bite your partner's lip too hard, you're not trying to eat your partner's face.Mix in small pecks with larger, more passionate kisses. Doing so adds variety and allows you to take breaks in between intense make-out sessions.\n",
            "Pay attention to your partner's body language\n",
            ". Kissing isn't just about paying attention to what you and your partner's lips are doing. Your whole body should be involved in the act of making out to achieve the most sensual and pleasurable experience possible. The way your partner moves the rest of his/her body while you are kissing can tell you a lot about how they are feeling and what they think about your performance.[7]Positive signs to look for: Your partner pulling you closer, squeezing you with his/her hands, kissing and caressing with a sense of intense urgency, breaking into random smiles or giggles, or frequent sighing. If you notice that your partner reacts in a particularly positive way to certain actions, be sure to take note. Your partner will appreciate your attentiveness and definitely recognize that you are making an impressive effort to understand what makes them feel the best.Negative signs to look for: Your partner pulling away, pushing your shoulder away, not touching you at all with his/her hands, barely moving his/her lips, or trying to close his/her lips as much as possible to force you to stop.\n",

            "Grab your partner's arms, shoulders and back.\n",
            "You can be a little more rough with these areas. A tight squeeze of your partner can send chills throughout their body. If you're feeling particularly sassy, give your partner a little butt squeeze. You'll be able to tell where they like to be touched by their body language.\n",
            "Place your hands on your partner's shoulders or around his/her waist.\n",
            "Move your fingers and/or thumb gently back and forth in a swaying motion to sweetly show your partner that you're there.[8]While women generally put their hands on a man's shoulders and men generally wrap their arms around a woman's waist, your position will more practically depend on the height difference between you and your partner.That being said, the placement isn't really important, the recognition of each other is what counts.\n",
            "Take your index finger or thumb and use it to lift up your partner's chin as you look into his/her eyes.\n",
            "Then go in for the kiss. This slight moment of visual recognition coupled with a light touch can be subtly pleasant.\n",
            "Gently pull on your partner's hair by running your fingers through the hair on the back of his/her head just above the neck.\n",
            "These gentle pulls really say \"I want you.\"\n",

Make sure to brush and floss twice daily to remove any bacteria build up in your mouth. Bacteria causes bad breath. Rinse with mouthwash for an added boost of freshness.\n",
            "Have a mint or chew some gum.\n",
            "Especially after consuming any food, make sure to pop a mint or chew some gum before kissing someone. If you choose to chew gum, make sure to spit it out before you start kissing. Your partner doesn't want to eat your leftover gum, and gum can also cause you to choke while kissing.\n",
            "Apply lip balm several times per day\n",
            ". Lip balms, especially products containing shea butter or various hydrating oils, are great for treating dry lips. Even if you generally don't have an issue with dry lips, lip balm can still make your lips even more kissable.Though they may taste good, avoid lip balms with artificial scents, flavors, and/or colors. These additives can actually be drying to your lips.Common natural lip balm brands include: Burt's Bees, Carmex, Chapstick, C.O. Bigelow, Nivea, Softlips, EOS, and Banana Boat.Right before you kiss your partner, apply a menthol-based lip balm. Menthol activates your body's cold receptors, and when you make contact with your partner, you and your partner will feel tingling sensations throughout your bodies.[11]Wear lip balm with at least SPF 15 when outdoors in order to protect your lips from harmful UV rays.\n",

Olive oil, coconut oil, and honey all work well as additions to a sugar scrub.[12]You can apply a generous coating to your lips and rub it in small circles using a toothbrush for extra exfoliation.Be sure not to scrub too hard, you just want to remove the dead skin, not make your skin raw.\n",
            "Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and nuts.\n",
            "Vitamins B, C, and Omega-3 fatty acids are extremely healthy for your skin. Make sure you are getting enough of these essential vitamins to keep your lips plump and soft.[13]\n",

            "Check for roof damage above water marks on the ceiling.\n",
            "Alternatively, wait until it rains so you can pin point the location of the leak.[1] If you havent already tracked down the leak, trace the water damage inside your home. If you have an attic, head up there with a flashlight, and look for water stains or mold. Note the location of any evidence you find, then inspect the corresponding spot on the exterior of your home.[2]If your roof is slanted, inspect areas that are higher than where youve found interior evidence of a leak. Water enters the leak then, due to gravity, it gets into the attic at a point farther down the roofs pitch.If you have trouble, run a hose for 1 to 2 minutes along different sections of the roof. Have a person inside alert you when they spot water.\n",
            "Inspect your roof for widespread wear and tear.\n",
            "Look for curled, cracked, or missing shingles at the leak site, and evaluate your roofs overall condition. See if there are numerous failing or missing shingles, wide gaps where roofing material meets vents or a chimney, and other signs of widespread wear and tear.[3]Repairing 1 or 2 shingles and resealing minor gaps are relatively easy fixes. However, patches of failing shingles and widespread wear are signs that your roof needs to be replaced, especially if its over 20 years old.Additionally, if you find widespread rot or mold on your roof boards or trusses inside your attic, you might have structural issues that require a professional roofer.\n",
            "Straighten and reattach curled shingles.\n",
            "Over time, the corners of asphalt shingles often begin to curl. Carefully smooth out any curled-back shingles, then use a caulking gun to apply a dab of roof sealant under the raised corners. Press the shingle down, then use a trowel to cover the shingles edges with roof cement.[4]Shingles are pliable in warm temperatures. Since theyre brittle in colder weather, you might need to soften a curled shingle with a blow dryer. Dont use a heat torch or any heat source more intense than a blow dryer, or youll damage the shingle.[5]\n",
            "Repair a clean crack with roof sealant.\n",
            "Theres no need to replace a shingle with a clean tear. Instead, apply a thick bead of roof sealant under the crack with a caulking gun. Press the shingle down, then apply another bead of sealant over the crack. Use a putty knife to spread the top bead over both edges of the crack.[6]To disguise your repair, look around the roof and in the gutter for accumulations of asphalt granules. Collect a small amount, then sprinkle them in the sealant to match its color to your shingles.\n",
            "Replace broken or missing shingles.\n",
            "If part or all of a shingle is missing, head to the hardware store to find a matching replacement. To replace a shingle, carefully lift the front edge of the shingle you are replacing and the one above it with a pry bar. Now use your pry bar and insert it way under the shingle you are replacing all the way to the nails holding it down and with a gentle force pry the shingle to loosen the nails, now use the pry bar or hammer  to remove the nails, you will also need to remove the nails from the shingles above as the nails will also be holding down the shingle you are replacing, once all nails are out slide shingle out, then scrape the area beneath to remove any leftover roofing cement.[7]If necessary, use a blow dryer to make the surrounding shingles more pliable. After removing the old shingle, use a sharp utility knife to round the back corners of the new shingle; this makes it easier to install.Slide the new shingle into place, gently lift the shingle above, and drive  inch (3.2cm) galvanized roofing nails into the new shingles corners.Now replace the nails that you removed from the shingle above.Finally, use a trowel to apply roof cement over the nail heads and edges of the new shingle.\n",

            "As you would with a shingle roof, check for damage on the exterior that corresponds with the water stains youve seen on the ceiling. Look closely for small cracks around joints, vents, chimneys, or other objects that come through the roof. More obvious signs of leaks include open splits in the roofing material and blisters or bubbles where water and air have collected.[8]You can mend a small gap at a joint, vent, or chimney with roofing sealant. Any gaps wider than in (0.64cm), open splits, or blistered areas will need to be patched.Like shingle repairs, mending minor damage to asphalt or rubber roll roofing is relatively easy. However, if you notice widespread wear, water stains, mold, or rot on the roof or ceiling, call a professional.\n",
            "Cut any blisters or bubbles to release air and water.\n",
            "Sweep away any gravel from the damaged area, then carefully slice through the middle of the blister with a utility knife. Cut only through the blister at the top layer of roofing; do not cut the roof substrate, or the fiberboard beneath the rubber or asphalt.[9]If the blister contained water, soak it up with a dry rag. After thoroughly mopping up water, allow it to dry for 12 to 24 hours. If youre in a rush, dry it out with a blow dryer; just be sure its completely dry before you attempt repairs.Blisters often occur with leaks in roll roofing. If there's no blister associated with your leak, skip this step and proceed to mending the tear.\n",
            "Spread a generous amount of roofing cement under the split.\n",
            "Inspect the fiberboard substrate beneath the tear in the rubber or asphalt. If the substrate is sound, use a small trowel to apply a heavy layer of cement under the edges of the tear. Push the cement as far under the edges as you can without further tearing the roofing material.[10]After cementing the edges of the tear, press it down flat, then drive galvanized roofing nails along each side of mend in 3in (7.6cm) intervals.If the fiberboard substrate is unsound, youll need to replace the damaged section.\n",
            "Replace the roofing substrate, if necessary.\n",
            "If youre dealing with a large, open seam, check the roof substrate beneath the rubber or asphalt for rot or holes. If its failing, use a straightedge and sharp utility knife to remove the damaged area. Carefully cut a rectangle-shaped section that contains all of the damaged roofing material.Check for and remove any metal washers and screws that secure the roof substrate to the structure beneath it.Using the section you removed as a template, cut a new piece of substrate from a sheet of high-density fiberboard, which you can purchase at your local hardware store.Set the new substrate into place, then secure it with in (3.8cm) roofing screws with built-in hex washers.\n",
            "Cover the repaired area with a patch of roll roofing.\n",
            "If you didnt need to replace the roof substrate, cut a patch of tar paper or rubber roll roofing 12in (30cm) wider and longer than the mended section. Apply a generous layer of roof cement over the repaired tear, then set the patch over the cement-covered area. Press it lightly, and drive in (3.2cm) galvanized roofing nails around the patchs edges in 3in (7.6cm) intervals.[11]If you did replace the substrate, add layers of rubber roll roofing until the area is flush with the surrounding roofing material. Cut a piece of tar paper or rubber roll roofing 12in (30cm) wider and longer than the repair area, apply a generous layer of cement, then set the patch over the cement-covered mend.After setting the patch in place, press it lightly and drive roofing nails around its perimeter. Ensure the nails that secure the patch dont overlap with any hardware you've used to hold the fiberboard substrate in place.\n",
            "Add a final layer of roofing cement for a watertight patch.\n",
            "After covering the mend with the patch, use your trowel to apply a heavy layer of roofing cement over the entire repaired area. Spread the cement over the patchs perimeter, and be sure to cover the nail heads. Use a putty knife to feather the cement past the patchs edges, and try to make a smooth surface that wont collect water.[12]If your roll roofing is asphalt, spread a layer of asphalt gravel over the cement while its still wet. This will help protect the roofing material.\n",
            "Inspect your roof for signs of damage.\n",
            "If you havent already tracked down the leak, follow the same steps as you would for any other roofing material. Look for roof damage on exterior areas that correspond with signs of a leak inside your home.[13] Keep an eye out for broken shakes, gaps in flashing, and other signs of wear and tear.[14]Shakes are basically shingles made out of wood instead of asphalt. If you have slate shingles, youll need to split them and saw off the nails as you would a wooden shake.Remember that replacing a shingle or shake here and there is relatively simple, but widespread wear and tear calls for a professional.\n",
            "Split damaged shakes with a hammer and chisel.\n",
            "Carefully position the chisel into the damaged shake, then strike the chisel with a hammer. Use a steady, controlled motion to avoid damaging adjacent shakes.[15]After splitting the damaged shake, remove the pieces with a set of pliers.\n",
            "Use a hacksaw to cut off the nails that secured the broken shake.\n",
            "Peer into the spot where the broken shingle sat, and locate the nails that secured it. Slide the hacksaw blade beneath the shingle above the one youve removed. Saw through the old nails where they protrude from the roof board to make room for the new shingle.[16]Be careful when using a hacksaw or any other sharp tools. If youre not confident in your ability to wield saws, hammers, or other tools on a pitched surface, call in a professional.\n",
            "Cut a new shake to fit into the gap.\n",
            "Purchase a shake that matches those on your roof online or at your local hardware store. Measure the width of the space where the old shake sat, and use a utility knife or fine-toothed saw to trim the new shake so itll fit into the gap.[17]Trim the new shake about in (0.95cm) less than the gaps width so itll have room to expand.\n",
            "Slide in the new shake, and secure it with 2 galvanized nails.\n",
            "First, slip the new shake under the one above the gap, and tap it to within 1in (2.5cm) of its final position (it should stick out a bit). Hammer 2 galvanized wood shingle nails into the new shake at an upward angle just below the edge of the shake above it.[18]Next, place a wood block against the new shake, and strike the block with a hammer to tap the shake into place. As the shake slides the last 1in (2.5cm) into place, itll pull the nail heads beneath the shake above it.If youre unable to use this technique to secure the nails inconspicuously, just drive the nails in directly below the shake above the replacement.\n",
            "Seal any exposed nail heads with roofing cement.\n",
            "If the nail heads arent completely covered by the shake above the replacement, apply dabs of cement over each head. Then smooth the cement surface with a putty knife or small trowel.[19]If your shakes or shingles are bonded by sealant and you broke the seal when you removed the old piece, apply a bead of roof sealant or cement around the edges of the replacement shake.\n",
            "Inspect areas where surfaces join, such as at a chimney or valley.\n",
            "Look for gaps in caulk, sealant, or aluminum flashing where any objects intersect with or emerge from the roof. These are some of the most common sources of roof leaks, and smaller gaps are easy to repair.[20]Small gaps can be treated with caulk or roof sealant, but larger cracks or tears require patching or new flashing.\n",
            "Apply roof sealant or cement to gaps less than 14in (0.64cm) wide.\n",
            "Scrape away old sealant, wipe away debris, and dry the area thoroughly before applying a new compound. Use a thin, flexible putty knife to apply roof cement to small cracks in the sealant around chimneys, pipes, or other joined surfaces. For small gaps at the metal or rubber collar of an exposed pipe or vent, apply a bead of waterproof silicone-based caulk with a caulking gun.[21]Gaps larger than in (0.64cm) will require a more substantial fix instead of a simple sealant.[22]\n",
            "Repair rusted or loose flashing at a joint.\n",
            "Flashing is typically made of steel or aluminum, and it seals joints around chimneys, valleys, siding, and walls that intersect the roof. If you find loose flashing, apply a bead of roof cement beneath it, then press it back into place.[23]If a small area of flashing is rusted, slide a new piece of galvanized steel flashing beneath the failing area, then seal it with roofing cement.[24]If youre any shingles adjacent to flashing are loose, avoid nailing the shingles on the side that makes contact with the flashing. Instead, bond the shingles to the flashing using roof cement to avoid puncturing the flashing.[25]\n",
            "Replace large areas of failing flashing, if necessary.\n",
            "Pry off stretches of unsound flashing and old roof cement with a chisel or pry bar. Measure your chimney, vent, or other joined area, and use a pair of straight cutting tin snips to cut a section of pre-bent base flashing to fit the joint. Your flashing should overlap the joint by about 4in (10cm) on each side.[26]Apply strips of ice-and-water barrier to the joint before installing the flashing. For a chimney or other object protruding from the roof, apply strips 4in (10cm) up the objects height.Wrap the flashing around the joint and seal it with roofing cement or caulk. If there are nail holes on the flashings edge, drive galvanized roofing nails into them.If you have a shingled roof, you might have needed to remove shingles in order to access the old flashing. Replace them, if necessary, and secure them to the flashing with roofing cement.Properly replacing all of the flashing around a chimney is complex and may require custom-made materials. If necessary, consult a professional.\n",

            "If you would like to watch the snail for a couple days, then release it back into your garden, something like a jam or pickle jar with holes poked would work pretty well. But your snails could get cut on the metal. So instead of a lid, you could use a piece of cheesecloth fitted over the rim of the container with an elastic band.Keep in mind that snails can climb vertical surfaces, and will attempt to escape if the container does not have a lid.\n",
            "Get a larger tank or terrarium such as a Kritter Keeper for long term pets.\n",
            "If you're keeping the snail for more than a few days, use a container that provides enough space for its size. Only baby snails or the smallest adult varieties can be kept long term in a plastic container.[1] Most require a larger tank to stay clean and healthy. You can purchase a terrarium at a pet store made for this purpose.Use a 5 gallon (19 L) tank or larger so the snail has room to move around. If you have several snails or intend to take care of young snails if the adult ones reproduce, get a larger tank.\n",
            "Make sure air can enter the terrarium.\n",
            "Just like humans, snails inhale air to use the oxygen, and exhale carbon dioxide. Your terrarium needs holes to let air in, ideally on multiple sides to allow for better air circulation. Some people have reported snails becoming more active when air was allowed to exit through a tiny gap in the bottom of the terrarium.[2]\n",
            "Keep the tank room temperature.\n",
            "As long as the tank is kept moist, many garden snails will be fairly resilient when it comes to temperatures. However, they will be most active and safe at room temperature. Keep them in the shade during hot weather, and avoid exposing them to freezing temperatures.\n",
            "Purchase terrarium soil or earth from outside.\n",
            "To reduce the chance of harmful bacteria, pesticides, and other dangers, purchase terrarium soil from a pet shop.[3] The next best option is to use natural earth from a garden not treated with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Put the soil in a layer at the base of the terrarium, fully covering the glass or plastic.Avoid potting soil for plants, which can contain chemicals harmful to snails.\n",
            "Add a layer of natural material on top of the soil.\n",

            "Put objects in the tank that the snails can hide in and climb onto, which will make them more comfortable and more interesting to watch. At most pet stores they have fake logs for small animals to crawl through or short hamster tubes that snails might enjoy. You might find material you can use in your garden as well! Never use rocks in your terrarium as snails could fall off the sides of the glass and break their shell. Bark and sticks usually fall apart after a few weeks, so you will need to replace them.Never use cardboard ornaments for your snails, as it will grow moss and fungi, resulting in your snail's death.\n",

            "Find snails to put in your container\n",
            ". Look for snails in muddy garden areas, old plant pots, or other moist places. If you can't see any, place a few pieces of fresh vegetables in your garden and check back later to see if there are snails eating them. Heavy rain often drives snails out into the open, so you'll have a better chance of success if you look during or following a rainstorm.Garden snails are almost always safe to handle, but it's a good idea to wash your hands before and after touching them to minimize the chance of harm to you or your snail.[5]If you do not want to touch the snails, wear gloves.\n",

            "Most snails are not picky eaters, and will enjoy most types of fresh fruit and vegetable. Wash all food thoroughly in clean water before you give it to them, and cut large vegetables into chunks or slices. Some foods, such as carrots and potatoes, may need to be boiled for a few minutes to soften them slightly. Always let cooked food cool completely before giving it to your snails.Some snails may eat raw meat, raw eggs, brown bread, or (soaked, but uncooked) oatmeal. Experiment to give your snails a varied diet to increase the chance that they are receiving all the nutrition they need.\n",
            "Learn which foods might harm your snails.\n",
            "Not much research has been done on the best nutritious diet for snails, and there is disagreement among snail owners about which foods may or may not harm the snails. Here are a list of food ranging from the most to least dangerous: Salty foods could kill your snails. Avoid anything with salt crystals on it entirely.Avoid pasta, rice, and millet. These starchy foods can potentially cause blockage in the snail's digestive system. Do not feed them to your snails.Homegrown plants may be exposed to car exhaust while growing, which could cause harm.Acidic foods such as citrus fruit, tomatoes, and kiwi fruit may or may not harm snails. Use them in small quantities along with other foods.\n",

            "You can use any source of calcium as long as it is clean and washed. Egg shells or discarded snail shells in your garden will work for the average pet owner. If you are trying to breed snails you may wish to buy more concentrated calcium sources from a pet store, such as cuttlefish bones or pure calcium supplements. Have a source of calcium available in the tank at all times. Replace it whenever it runs out, but use calcium supplements with greater than 20% calcium sparingly.\n",

            "Install the full tiles surrounding the toilet first.\n",
            "Take your time planning out your tile pattern and creating grid lines on the subfloor so that you need to make as few angular/circular tile cuts as possible. When you're tiling around an already-installed toilet, plan out your pattern so that at there is at least 2in (5.1cm) of space between the base of the toilet and the edges of any of the tiles you'll be laying around it.You'll usually save time (due to a greater margin for error with your tile cuts) if you remove the toilet, tile the floor, and then reinstall or replace the toilet. However, tiling around an existing toilet may be preferable in some cases.Tiling around an installed toilet is easier if the base rests flush against the wall behind the toilet. If you have to tile all the way around the base, including the small space between it and the wall, strongly consider removing the toilet, tiling around the toilet flange, and reinstalling the toilet.\n",
            "Create sheets of paper that are the same size as a whole tile.\n",
            "Simply cut the paper to match the size of the tilefor instance, 16 by 16in (41 by 41cm). Cut one sheet for each tile you'll need to lay around the base of the toilet.\n",
            "Estimate your tile cuts and cut parallel slits in the paper in these areas.\n",
            "Visualize how each tile will fit around the toilet base, and estimate which parts of each tile will need to be cut away. Transfer these estimates to the corresponding sheets of paper, and use scissors to cut parallel slits that are about 0.25in (0.64cm) apart in the areas that will need to be removed. When doing so, it's better to overestimate the area that will need to be removed than to underestimate.For instance, imagine that you have a toilet with an angular base that will necessitate cutting a triangular section away from one of the corners of one of your tiles. You'd cut the parallel slits into that same area of the corresponding sheet of paper, with a little extra wiggle room added to your cuts.\n",
            "Lay each sheet into place and crease the slits along the toilet base.\n",
            "One at a time, lay the sheets of paper down where their corresponding tiles will go, remembering to account for spacing between tiles due to grout lines. The slits will fan up and over the installed toilet's base. Use your finger to press a crease into each slitone at a timewhere the subfloor meets the toilet base.When you're done, you'll have created an accurate template for that tile. Then you can move onto the next sheet of paper.To account for future grout lines, utilize the same plastic spacers that you use when permanently setting the tiles in place.\n",
            "Cut the slits along the traced lines and dry-fit the sheets.\n",
            "Once you've creased all the sheets of paper, take your scissors and cut carefully along the crease lines. Then, lay all these cut sheets of paper down around the toilet (again, accounting for grout lines) and make sure they fit snugly against the toilet base. If one or more do not, get more paper and repeat the process.You want the finished tiles to rest right up against the base of the toilet, so take your time to make sure the paper templates fit precisely.\n",
            "Tape the sheets to the tiles, then trace and scribe the cut lines.\n",
            "When all the paper templates are just right, tape each one to a tile and use a pencil to transfer the cut pattern. After that, remove the paper and use a tile scribe to score 0.125in (0.32cm) deep lines into the tiles, tracing right over top of the pencil lines.Tile scribes can look like thick pencils or come in other shapes. Look for them at hardware stores or online.\n",
            "Remove the unneeded tile with tile nippers.\n",
            "Slowly and carefully squeeze the handles to snip away small bites of tile from the sections that need to be removed. Turn your small bites into tiny nibbles as you get to the score lines. If you try to snip off too much, you risk breaking the tile and having to start over.Tile nippers look and work like giant fingernail clippers, and are an essential tool for any tile job. Standard nippers will cut ceramic and porcelain tiles, but you may want to use specialty nippers for glass tiles or fragile stone tiles (like slate).Wear safety glasses so shards of tile don't get into your eyes, and sturdy work gloves to protect your hands from sharp tile edges.\n",
            "Smooth the cuts with a tile file and wipe the tiles down.\n",
            "Once you've finished cutting a tile with the tile nippers, use the tile file to sand down any rough edges along the cut. Follow this up with a damp cloth to wipe away any dust. After this, dry-fit the tile to make sure it rests snugly along the toilet base. If it doesn't, keep nipping, or get a new tile and start again if necessary.When all the tiles have been cut, filed, cleaned, and dry-fitted, you can move on to setting them in place permanently.\n",
            "Tile the areas away from the toilet flange first.\n",
            "When tiling a bathroom, mark out your desired grid pattern on the floor, and lay tile over the unobstructed areas first. Don't tile around the toilet flangethe circular piece that connects to the drain pipe and upon which the toilet itself will restuntil the end.Draw out a grid pattern for the tile layout on paper, and then on the subfloor itself, that reduces the number of tile cuts you need to make. If you're using larger tilese.g., 12 by 12in (30 by 30cm) or largeryou may be able to cut a circle out of a single tile to go around the flange.\n",
            "Cut one or more sheets of paper that match the size of your tiles.\n",
            "If you need to cut 1 tile to go around the flange, cut 1 sheet of paper; if you need 4 tiles, cut 4 sheets of paper. Be as precise as possible in sizing the sheets of paper properly.[1]For instance, if your tiles are 8 by 8in (20 by 20cm), cut your sheets of paper to those dimensions.\n",
            "Lay the sheet(s) of paper in place, overlapping the flange.\n",
            "Place the sheet(s) of paper exactly where the tile(s) will go, making sure to account for the spacing of your grout lines. That is, if your other tiles are spaced 0.125in (0.32cm) apart due to the grout lines, leave this same gap between the set tiles and your paper.[2]You can employ the same plastic spacers you use when laying the tile to make sure your grout line spacing is consistent with your paper templates.If you only need to cut a single tile, just lay a single sheet of paper right over the flange.\n",
            "Trace the outline of the flange onto the sheet(s) of paper.\n",
            "First, run your finger along the outline of the flange to create a crease in the paper. Then, lift up each sheet and use a pencil to trace an outline that's slightlyabout 0.25in (0.64cm) larger than the creased outline.[3]The tracing doesn't need to be perfect, because the toilet will rest on top of the flange and the cut tile(s) and hide any minor errors.If you have a removable flange and want it to rest on top of the tile(s) instead of on the subfloor, make the pencil tracing about 0.5in (1.3cm) smaller than your crease outline instead. That way, the outer rim of the flange will rest on the surrounding tile(s).[4]\n",
            "Cut out the flange circle and trace it onto the tile(s).\n",
            "Use scissors to cut the sheet(s) of paper to the correct shape, then tape the sheet(s) onto the tile(s). Transfer the cut lines onto the tile(s) with a pencil, then remove the paper.[5]Don't discard the paper yetyou'll need it again if you break a tile while cutting it!\n",
            "Score the cut lines with a tile scribe.\n",
            "A tile scribe is a small, sharp hand tool that etches a cut line into the tile. This etching helps make sure the tile snaps where you want it to instead of breaking or cracking elsewhere. The scoring only needs to be 0.125in (0.32cm) or so deep.You can get a tile scribe at any hardware store or online.\n",
            "Use tile nippers to clip away the excess tile.\n",
            "Think of tile nippers as industrial-strength fingernail clippers. Start at the corner of the tile that's being cut away, and squeeze the handles together to make the top and bottom blades take small bites out of the tile. Start nibbling more carefully as you approach the scored line.Standard tile nippers will work with practically every kind of tile, although some natural stone tiles (like slate) may be too fragile. Consult your tile supplier if needed. You can also use specialty tile nippers for glass tiles or other particular types.Be careful not to nip one of your fingers while you work. Wear work gloves to protect your hands from cut tile edges and safety glasses to protect your eyes from snipped shards of tile.\n",
            "Make sure your cuts are correct by dry-fitting the tiles.\n",
            "Because the toilet base will cover the cut tile edge, your cuts don't need to be perfect. However, take the time to dry-fit the tiles in place to make sure your cuts are generally accurateideally, no more than 0.5in (1.3cm) larger than the flange.Use plastic spacers to account for your grout lines when dry-fitting the tiles.If you're going to rest a removable toilet flange on top of the installed tiles, remember to remove it before dry-fitting (and later, when laying the tile!).If your dry-fit lines up properly, you're ready to set these tiles in place in the same way you did the rest of the floor.\n",
            "Use an angle grinder to score the circular shape into the tile.\n",
            "Attach a 4in (10cm) diamond wheel blade to the grinder, and position it so the circular blade is at roughly a 45-degree angle to the tile. Slowly work your way around the circle traced into the tile, using very light pressure. You only need to score the tile about 0.125in (0.32cm) deep on this initial pass.[6]Use caution at all times. Tie back long hair and remove any dangling jewelry, and wear long sleeves and safety glasses. The grinder will kick up a lot of dust, so wear a dust mask and consider buying a vacuum attachment that you can connect to your grinder.Angle grinders are an affordable and useful small power tool you can find at any hardware store. Diamond blades are more expensive than other blades you can get for the grinder, but they cut through tile much better.[7]\n",
            "Cut sacrificial break notches if the circle is near the tile's edge.\n",
            "If there is less than about 1.5in (3.8cm) of space between your traced circle and an edge of the tile, there's a good chance the tile will break while cutting it. If this is the case, use the grinder to cut 2 or more deep score lines (about halfway through the tile) that run from the perimeter of the circle to the closest edge of the tile.[8]The goal is to have the tile snap at these chosen, controlled spots, instead of randomly.Straight, short, controlled breaks in the tile will be barely noticeable once you set the tile in place, especially since the toilet will be resting on top of it.\n",
            "Continue grinding around the circle with gentle pressure.\n",
            "Once you've finished scoring the tile surface and creating any sacrificial break notches, keep making slow, steady passes with the grinder at a 45-degree angle. If the tile breaks at the sacrificial points, remove that section and keep cutting. Eventually, you'll grind your way through the tile and have the circular cutout that you need.[9]Don't try to cut more than about 0.125in (0.32cm) deep with any single pass, or the tile will probably break in a random spot and you'll have to start over.Be as precise as possible but remember that the circle you cut doesn't need to be perfect. The actual cut line will be covered by the toilet base.\n",
            "Dry-fit the tile over the flange to make sure it fits.\n",
            "Check your work before you attempt to secure the tile in place permanently. So long as your circular cutout is less than 0.5in (1.3cm) larger than the toilet flange all the way around, the base of the toilet should cover the cutout.[10]Once you know the tile fits properly, you can secure it to the floor permanently.\n",

            "Choose a lemon or vinegar to clean your zinc.\n",
            "If you aren't worried about removing the patina from your zinc objects, use lemon juice or vinegar to clean your objects. If you choose lemon juice, you will need one or two lemons cut in half.If you choose to use vinegar, use plain, white vinegar.\n",
            "Choose toothpaste or a baking soda paste.\n",

If you choose to use toothpaste, any kind of toothpaste, i.e., Arm & Hammer, Colgate, or Aquafresh, will work.If you choose to make a baking soda paste, depending on how large the object is, use a teaspoon (for smaller objects like jewelry) to a tablespoon (for larger objects like tabletops or pots) of baking soda. Then gradually mix in water until a paste forms. Gradually mix in the water by alternating mixing with water. For example, add a few drops of water, mix, and then gradually add more water until a paste forms.\n",
            "Use an old toothbrush.\n",
            "When cleaning small or hard to reach areas, use a toothbrush that you can discard. This can be an old toothbrush that you do not use or one that you are willing to replace. After using the toothbrush, instead of throwing it away, store it with your cleaning supplies so you can reuse it again.\n",
            "Place the item on a cloth or a paper towel.\n",

            "Use a toothbrush to clean small areas.\n",

            "Bounce the ball on your thigh.\n",
            "Although soccer primarily uses the feet, beginners at kick ups should master using the thighs first because it's a bit easier than foot juggling. The ball should hit the flat surface of the thigh, not anywhere on the knee. Drop the ball to the thigh, bounce it once, and catch it. Do this for enough reps to get the motion down before going for multiple bounces.\n",
            "Use the bridge of your foot on the laces.\n",
            "When the thighs are mastered, incorporate the feet. Drop the ball and make contact with it where the toes start. Keep your toes pointed slightly up so that the ball bounces up rather than forward.If you straighten your toes out to point forward, the ball is more likely to bounce away from you.Start with one bounce at a time off your foot, making sure the ball goes straight up. When you get good at keeping the ball straight, go for more kicks in a row.\n",
            "Start using your non-dominant foot.\n",
            "Most people have a dominant foot, and it's easier to let that foot do all the work, but the players who are best at kick ups will be equally strong with both feet. Once you get good with your dominant foot, begin practicing just as hard with your other foot.This will give your dominant foot a break during competitive kicks ups and give you more options to get a pattern going.\n",
            "Launch the ball up to your head, using either your foot or thigh.\n",
            "Kicking the ball with just the right amount of power up to your head is tricky and takes time to perfect. When you kick the ball into the air, it should be just out in front of your head so that you have to lean slightly forward to hit it. The ball should bounce off the flat part of your head rather than your forehead.Work to hit the ball straight up off your head rather than forward or backward.Moving the ball from your foot to your head may be a little easier than from your thigh to your head because you can get more power with your foot.\n",
            "Practice consistently.\n",
            "Beating others at kick ups means being consistently better than them, which is only achieved by practicing. You should practice kick ups techniques every day to build the strength in your legs and to form muscle memory for the motion juggling the ball takes. One way to practice is to set a certain time limit for which you must work on the skills, and then increase this time a little bit every day.Try to go for 10 seconds straight or for 10 reps without dropping the ball. Set a goal like this and then as you reach it, set a new, slightly higher goal.\n",
            "Find the motion that works best for you.\n",
            "Being comfortable with juggling will help you win kick ups more often, so if a certain way of moving feels better, do it that way. Some people like to move the foot at the ankle to pop the ball up, while others prefer slightly extending the knee to kick at the ball. You can even move your bent leg up and down at the hip.[1]Try using each approach for a few minutes and see which feels the most natural to you. Then get proficient at that style.\n",
            "Do drills to get the technique just right.\n",
            "You can't start out with the goal of getting 50 bounces on the first try. On a hard surface, bounce the ball off the ground and kick it up once into your hands. Drop it again and kick it twice, with a bounce in between, before catching it. Then kick it twice with no bounce and catch it. This progression will help get the exact motion right before going for too long.[2]You want the ball to go straight up after the kick without too much spin, so if you do one kick and it doesn't go straight up, stay on that step of the drill until you can kick it straight up. This gives you a foundation to build on.You can build on this basic drill by passing it from one foot to the other, going from foot to head back to thigh, or do 10 reps on the foot, then 10 on the thigh, then 10 on the head. The goal of drills is to get the technique right on a few reps before trying for the most reps.\n",
            "Watch the ball.\n",
            "It may feel like keeping your eye on the ball makes you seem weak, but it is the most effective way to keep the ball going. You may think your foot or leg was positioned perfect for a pass up to your head, but watching the ball will help you know for sure. Where the ball goes will tell you whether or not you got the technique right.[3]You can practice juggling the ball without looking, to push yourself, but when you are playing to win, watching will give you an added edge on your opponent.\n",
            "Focus on your balance.\n",
            "Kick ups requires you to be on one foot for an extended period of time, so having exceptional balance is a useful aspect to master. If you are wobbling all over the place with each kick, you will have less control of where the ball goes. Work hard to maintain upright posture and only move enough to keep the ball moving.[4]A good way to practice is just standing on one foot for as long as you can, while staying up straight and not swaying. Once you can stand still for a long time, you'll be able to practice the movement of kicking.\n",
            "Move the ball through a pattern.\n",
            "Some people playing kick ups move the ball around at random and are constantly reacting to wherever the ball goes. You can win by having greater control than your opponent. Move the ball in a pattern, using each body part. If you move the ball in a pattern, you'll know exactly where it is going rather than guessing.A good pattern might be right foot, left foot, left thigh, right thigh, head. Or you could go up the right side and down the left side by cycling right foot, right thigh, head, left thigh, left foot. The goal is planning ahead where you are passing the ball to.\n",

            "Start by calculating the number of free hours you have each day.\n",
            "Grab your class schedule so you can figure out how much time you have to work with outside of class. Then, divide your available free time into blank study blocks.[1]Dont forget about free blocks of time in between classes, too. You can get a lot of work done during free periods.[2]Studies show that studying in short bursts is the most effective way to learn.[3]\n",
            "Use due dates and deadlines to prioritize different tasks at certain times.\n",
            "Avoid assigning yourself vague tasks like \"Study literature. Instead, check your planner to see whats coming up in the next few weeks, then assign tasks accordingly. Use key words like read, write, review, outline, and memorize\" so you know exactly what you need to do.For example, if you have a history exam coming up in 2 weeks, you might write in study block tasks like review lecture notes, go over highlighted concepts, do practice questions in text, make vocabulary flashcards, and so on.\n",
            "Spread chunks out over several days so you don't stress out.\n",
            "If you need to write an essay that you know will take you about 4 hours to complete, dont devote a 4-hour block of time to it on a single day. Youll just end up overwhelming yourself and the rest of your schedule will get thrown off track, too. Instead, break the work into several 30-50 minute chunks over the course of a week or so.[4]Breaking the work down into manageable pieces and spreading it over several days helps you manage your studies more effectively.[5]\n",
            "You can devote extra time to classes that are important to you.\n",
            "As youre assigning subjects to study blocks, consider which classes are the toughestyoull probably need to assign longer and/or more frequent study blocks to those particular subjects. You might also want to devote more time to key subjects, like the ones specific to your major, and spend less time studying for your electives.For example, if calculus isnt your strong suit, devote 50-minute blocks to that subject every other day. If English is a breeze for you, a 30-minute block every 3-4 days might be all you need. If art history is an elective, you might only need to study for that once a week.\n",
            "You dont need to study the same subject two days in a row!\n",
            "Youll retain more information and experience less burnout if you space things out. For example, assign blocks of time for studying calculus and science on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Then, schedule blocks for literature and history on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.[6]Aim to study each subject as soon as possible after leaving that particular class to retain the most information.[7]\n",
            "Write all of your test dates and assignment deadlines in your planner.\n",

            "Give yourself 5- to 10-minute breaks between study blocks.\n",
            "Slogging away for hours at a time will do more harm than good, so breaks are crucial! If you tend to lose track of time, set a timer at the beginning of each study block so you dont miss a break.[9]You can do whatever you want during breaks! Stretch, check your phone, get a snack, hit the restroom, or go for walk. The most important thing is to get up and walk away from your desk so youre truly breaking from the material.[10]\n",
            "It's important to make time for fun, exercise, and rest.\n",
            "The best study plan is a balanced one! Recreational activities, healthy meals, exercise, and getting plenty of sleep are crucial if you want to make the rest of your schedule stick. You'll be able to stay on track and perform at your best when you're taking care of all your needs.[11]For example, block out a 4-hour window every Sunday to chill with friends.Carve out 30 minutes a day to walk, jog, or do any other exercises you enjoy.Don't forget to block out 7-9 hours every night for sleep, too! Getting a little less than that is okay occasionally, but sticking to a consistent sleep schedule will help you feel your best.\n",
            "This helps solidify your schedule until it becomes routine.\n",
            "You dont have to study in one devoted space for every study block, of course! Just choose a good place for each study block that makes sense with your schedule and stick to that location every time.[12]For example, if you have a free hour to study between history and literature, go to the library for that study session. Pick your favorite table on the second floor and make that your spot.\n",
            "Use a dedicated notebook for each class so you dont get mixed up.\n",

            "Take a few seconds to evaluate the situation.\n",
            "This can make all the difference in winning. Thinking rationally, even for a few seconds, will help you to remain calm so that you can fight with your mind as well as your body.Determine whether your opponent seems to be angry (at you or just in general), looking for a fight, mentally ill, or drunk. This information can help you decide the best way to quickly end the fight.Before you decide how to fight (or flee), evaluate your opponent's size and strength. Keep in mind the old adage that \"The good big man beats the good little man.\" [1] This doesn't mean that you can't win a fight against an opponent who is larger and stronger than you, but it does mean that you should take these factors into account.\n",
            "De-escalate anger.\n",
            "If your opponent is yelling, threatening you, or throwing things, but has not yet attacked you physically, you may be able to de-escalate the situation and avoid a fight altogether.You must remain calm yourself. Responding to anger with anger will only make the situation worse.Tell your opponent you want to hear what he has to say. Listen carefully. If your opponent is in pain or upset, listening quietly may calm them down.\n",
            "Be wary of unpredictable opponents.\n",
            "If your opponent is acting irrationally and unpredictably - such as someone who is drunk or mentally ill - it will be more difficult to de-escalate, but it can be done.An opponent who is impaired might not really want to fight you once he's calmed down. This may influence your decision about whether to fight or to try to de-escalate the situation.To try to help someone who is impaired to calm down, listen to the person, agree with whatever he says, and then tell him what you want him to do (e.g. sit down, leave). The key is to repeat the loop as many times as it takes - even a dozen times. This technique fails if you give up too soon. [2]\n",
            "Avoid your opponent's first attack.\n",
            "If he is rushing at you or throwing a punch, move to the side, then push him down from behind when he has passed you. If the opponent is not a lot bigger than you, you can try sticking your leg in front of him and then pushing him to trip him. This technique uses the opponent's momentum against him.You must remain calm and move quickly to get out of the way. Your instincts to avoid a punch or kick should help, but be aware that you may also 'freeze'.When you push your opponent, try to thrust away from the ground with your legs and follow through with your arms to deliver the most force possible.\n",
            "Don't fight the way your opponent wants to.\n",
            "Most people will tend to use one style of fighting - punching, grappling, kicking, etc. Don't engage with the same technique.If your opponent punches, try to drag him to the ground.If your opponent seems to want to tackle you, try to stay on your feet.\n",
            "Fight dirty.\n",
            "Fighting techniques such as Krav Maga encourage explosive attacks against the opponent's weakest points. Hit soft, weak parts of your opponent's body (toes, groin, stomach, face, side of the neck) with hard, strong parts of your body (your heel, knee, elbow, heel of your hand, top of your head).[3]Stomp on your opponent's toes.Kick or punch his groin, the top of his stomach (solar plexus), or the belly button area (diaphragm).Gouge your opponent's eyes, or punch him in the nose, chin, or jaw as hard as you can.If you are being attacked and have access to anything that can be used as a weapon, use it. You can throw things, such as keys or sand, gravel, or dirt, as well as using things as weapons.[4] You have a right to defend yourself in any way you can. Just keep in mind this doesn't extend to attacking.\n",

            "If you are good at bluffing or acting, you may be able to trick your opponent into making the fight easier for you.Adopt a martial-arts style stance and put your fists up in front of your face to encourage your opponent to do the same. If your opponent is not a trained fighter, he may mimic your stance, which puts you in control of the fight.Bluff a kick from the side. Make it look like you're going to kick your opponent in the shin. Instead, deliver a strong punch to his face, solar plexus, or diaphragm. Avoid the temptation to look down at your leg, which may telegraph your plan to your opponent.If your opponent does not mimic you, this may tell you that he has some training or practice as a fighter.\n",

            "This approach, popular among UFC fighters, can stun your opponent and knock him down. Knowing the proper way to punch can make the difference between you hurting your opponent and you hurting your hand.Make sure your thumb is on the outside of your fist.Punch with your knuckles - particularly those of your index and ring fingers - and keep your wrist straight. This will deliver a more effective punch and will also make it less likely that you will break any bones in your hand.[6]While UFC fighters like Gray Maynard, James Irvin, and Todd Duffee took out their opponents by throwing punches to the head[7][8][9], less trained fighters may have better luck landing a strong punch by aiming for the throat, sides of the neck, or ribs.[10]Even though some fighters such as Ryan Jimmo have knocked opponents out with one blow[11], keep in mind that single-punch knockouts are extremely rare, even in professional boxing and mixed martial arts (MMA).\n",

A low, strong kick to the knee or shin is much faster and more effective than a high kick to the head.Aim the side of your foot toward the side of your opponent's knee - this will help you maintain your balance while doing maximum damage.[13]One advantage to kicking is that it keeps you farther away from your opponent, thereby making it harder for him to hit you.[14]\n",
            "How to Sell Copper (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n",
            "Know the different of categories of copper.\n",
            "Scrap copper can fall into one of six different categories.  The different categories each have different values.  If you sort the copper yourself, you can be sure that the scrap yard purchasing it is giving you the appropriate price.  Otherwise, they are likely to lump all of your copper into one pile and give you the lowest overall price.[1]Copper solids are the most valuable.  Copper solids are further categorized into three grades, depending on how pure they are.Copper non solids include dust and trimmings.Copper wire is generally found in electronics.Copper breakage is copper that has been recovered from items like motors and transformers.Copper alloy is copper mixed with other metals.  This includes brass and bronze.\n",
            "Recognize copper solids.\n",
            "Copper solids are the most valuable kinds of copper to sell.  They consist of pure, unalloyed copper.  Unalloyed means that the copper is not mixed with any other kind of metal.  The purity of copper determines its value because any added alloys interfere with the conductive properties of the copper.[2]    Copper solids fall into one of three categories.Scrap copper number one is clean copper that is not less than 1/16-inch thick.[3] Bare bright copper wire falls into this category.  Bare bright copper wire can be distinguished from the less-valuable tin-coated copper wire by its reddish color all the way through.[4]  Some copper tubing can also fall into this category. The tubing must be free of solder, corrosion, paint and brass fitting to be considered number one copper.[5]Scrap copper number two is defined as unalloyed copper that is at least 96 percent pure.[6]  Copper tubing that falls into this category includes burnt copper and copper with light tin coating, solder or brass fittings still attached[7]Scrap copper number three is light copper.  Light copper solids are any copper sheeting that is less than 1/16-inch thick.  Roofing copper generally falls into this category.  It is found on roofs and gutters, and it may have tar or nails still attached.[8]\n",
            "Identify copper non solids.\n",
            "This category includes dust, chips and turnings.  It is generally not very valuable, and can fetch as low as 25 percent of the spot price of copper.  If you have access to this type of copper, save it up until you get at least 10 pounds or more and then melt it down into nuggets before trying to sell it.[9]To melt copper dust, turnings or scraps, you will need materials specifically made for melting and casting metals.  The melting point of copper is 1,981 degrees Fahrenheit,[10] so you need a kiln or furnace that can withstand that kind of heat.  A potter's kiln can get hot enough to melt copper, but the oxidation process required to maintain that kind of heat will burn away a lot of the copper.  Also, it will heavily contaminate the kiln.  Look for bronze foundry casting tools and an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non-ferrous metals.[11]Artists often melt brass and copper for sculpture, and many have posted detailed tutorials for building a homemade furnace.  Visit the Foundry Handbook for an example of a detailed tutorial for a DIY furnace using an oxy-acetylene torch for welding and a disposable helium tank or empty freon tank.[12]Be aware, however, that the cost of powering the furnace with propane or electric will eat up about half the value of the copper.  Therefore, it might not be worth investing in this process unless you have a steady, reliable source of a great deal of copper non-solids.[13]Exercise caution when melting metal.  For your safety, have safety gear such as protection goggles or face shield, dark welding goggles, oven gloves, a large flat iron pan to put the mold on, and running cold water.\n",
            "Sort scrap copper wire.\n",
            "While copper wire can technically be segregated into five grades, most scrap yards classify all wire as either high grade or low grade copper wire.  High grade wire has a single layer of insulation, and low grade has a double layer.  The five grades of copper wire range from 85 percent to 10 percent.[14]85% wire is a thin wire with a diameter close to that of a pencil.70% wire can generally be found inside electronics or appliances.  An example is Romex machine wire without any attachments.50% wire is found in extension cords and appliance cords.35% wire is thinly gauged wire with many attachments. This wire is generally used for communications in VGA cables or telephone wires.10% wire can be found in Christmas lights.\n",
            "Disassemble scrap breakage.\n",
            "Copper breakage is anything with copper winding.[15] Transformers, motors, alternators and magnetrons are all examples of copper breakage.[16]  Disassemble parts to separate the copper from the steel in order to get the best price for the copper.  Otherwise the scrap yard will lump the less valuable steel and copper together and you wont get as much.[17]\n",
            "Sell the copper alloys.\n",
            "Common copper alloys are brass and bronze.  Technically, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.  But scrap yards lump them together and sell them at the same price.  They refer to them both scrap copper alloys.[18]\n",
            "Separate all metals before going to the yard.\n",
            "Before bringing your copper to the scrap yard, first sort your copper yourself into its three different grades.  Sort tubing and wire into their different categories.  This will give you an approximate idea of the overall value of your scrap copper.  Unsorted and uncategorized lots of copper tend to sell for lower prices.[19]\n",
            "Strip insulation off copper wire to get the best price.\n",
            "Before purchasing an expensive wire stripper, decide if you are going to be selling enough copper wire on a regular basis to make the investment worthwhile.  A general rule of thumb is that if you are stripping more than 1,000 pounds of wire per month, then you should purchase an electric wire stripper.[20]If you are stripping less than 1,000 pounds per month, you do not need to invest in a wire stripper.If you decide not to buy a wire stripper, warm the wire first.  Place it in the oven on low or put it inside a black box and leave it in the sun.  This makes the insulation softer and easier to remove with a handheld stripping tool.Never under any circumstances should you burn the insulation off the wire.\n",
            "Melt copper non solids into nuggets.\n",
            "Scrap yards will not purchase dust or turnings.  Many sellers dont even bother saving these because they are not valuable.  If you have these materials, consider saving them until you have at least 10 pounds and then melting them down into nuggets with an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non-ferrous metals. A scrap yard may give you something for the nuggets, but be prepared to accept a price of up to 75 percent below market value for copper.  It might not be worth the cost of the electricity or propane to run the furnace.[21]If you do decide to melt down copper dust and trimmings to sell it, invest in the right materials for melting copper.  Copper melts at a temperature of 1,981 degrees Fahrenheit.  Purchase metal casting materials that are specifically designed to withstand this kind of heat and melt copper and other non-ferrous metals.  Typically, artists use these materials for casting bronze or copper sculpture.  You can find a furnace and other materials for melting copper at a bronze foundry.  Or, you can use an artist's tutorial, such as this one to build a furnace yourself.[22]Exercise caution.  Equip yourself with safety gear such as googles, face masks, oven gloves and running water.  If using a homemade furnace, carefully check all gas couplings for leaks.  Keep all flammable materials a safe distance away from the furnace.Be environmentally conscious when melting metals.  Use as much exhaust to heat the flame as possible so you are not wasting gas or electricity. Dispose of any waste from the process at a recycling center for hazardous materials.\n",
            "Separate copper breakage.\n",
            "Some scrap yards will purchase transformers and motors that contain copper at a special breakage price.  But you should take them apart and separate the copper to get the best value.[23]When taking apart transformers, dont bother trying to cut the steel because it is too hard.  Instead, cut the copper.  It is softer and more malleable.[24]Try heating transformers in a bucket over a fire for 20 to 30 minutes.  After heating, fill the bucket with ice water.  The transformers will become very weak from the sudden change in temperature and be much easier to take apart.[25]Exercise safety precautions.  Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.  Wear heat resistant gloves to protect your hands.  Handle hot pieces with tongs to avoid having to touch them.\n",
            "Research the best prices.\n",
            "Check commodity trading prices on NASDAQ or CNBC.com to find the latest price for high-grade copper.  Other trade service websites, such as specialty metal sites or investment sites, list the daily prices for metals including copper.[26]Prices for commodities, including copper, are affected by market forces and change every day.  Between 2004 and 2009, copper surged in value from approximately $1 per pound to close to $4 per pound. The value dipped dramatically in 2009 during the recession to approximately $1.50 per pound.  But the price rebounded by 2012 to an all-time high of approximately $4.50 per pound.  Since then, the price of copper has decreased.  As of September, 2015, the price of copper per pound is about $2.43 per pound.[27]\n",
            "Find a scrap yard.\n",
            "Consult a website like 1-800-Got Scrap, Recycler Finder or iScrap.  These websites let you search by location and by material you have to sell.  They also tell you the price the yard is offering for scrap.You can also find local scrap yards by looking in the phone book or doing a search on the internet. Call ahead to find out the price they are offering.Look for a scrap yard with a good reputation for customer service.  Some scrap yard owners may try to take advantage of you. Find someone whom you can trust and with whom you can see yourself doing more business.[28]\n",
            "Call ahead to get their prices.\n",
            "If you have done your research about the current value of copper, this will help you assess whether the scrap yard is offering a fair price.  Call several scrap yards and find the one with the best price.  Try negotiating with them if you can to get the best price.  If they wont offer you a fair price, look elsewhere. [29]\n",
            "Find out if they will pick up.\n",
            "Some scrap yards will come to you to pick up your scrap.  But they may charge you for the service.  Compare what they are charging you with the cost of delivering it yourself, which includes your time and gas.  Decide if having it picked up is worth the price.[30]\n",
            "Haul your copper to the scrap yard.\n",
            "If you decide to deliver it yourself, you can use whatever vehicle you choose.  However, if you are going to be delivering lots of heavy loads, consider using a sturdy pickup truck.  A pickup bed allows easy unloading.  If you haul your copper in a closed vehicle like a car or SUV, it might be more difficult to unload.[31]\n",
            "Weigh your copper.\n",
            "Many scrap yards weigh your fully-loaded vehicle when you arrive.  They use a large, accurate, pressure-sensitive plate to weigh your vehicle.  After unloading the copper, they weigh your vehicle again.  The difference is the weight of your scrap.[32]\n",
            "Unload your vehicle.\n",
            "Since copper is a non-ferrous material, the yard cannot use a mag crane to remove it from your truck.  Other ferrous materials like iron and steel can be removed from truck beds by the magnet on the mag crane. But since copper is not magnetic, the scrap yard will likely use a forklift instead.[33]\n",
            "Register your personal information.\n",
            "Since copper theft has become such a problem, the government now requires the use of security systems to try to catch copper thieves.  When you sell copper at a scrap yard, you will likely be required to register in a database that links a photo and a description of the copper you sold with your personal information. In addition, your thumbprint is recorded.  Authorities can review these records to link sellers to reported copper thefts.[34]\n",
            "Get paid.\n",
            "Some scrap yards may pay you with cash.  However, if the scrap yard is participating in the government's security database system, they may be prohibited from paying you in cash.  In this case, they will likely have an automated teller machine that pays you.  The scrap yard will give you a slip of paper with the specified payment.  You can input this into the automated teller machine, and it will give you your cash.[35]\n",
            "Find specific sources of copper that are always reliable.\n",
            "Most people who sell scrap copper don't rely on finding it by chance. They have sources on which they rely to find a steady supply of copper to sell.  For example, you might be able to set up an agreement with an appliance repair store to pick up damaged goods you know contain copper.  They might be happy to allow you to recycle what would otherwise wind up in a landfill.[36]\n",
            "Find copper wire inside old electronics.\n",
            "Cut wires off the outside.  Wire can be snipped off of TVs and monitors with scissors.  Cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile.  The small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile.  Search inside for insulated wires and connectors.[37]Thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops, VCRs and DVD players.Take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive.Large appliances are often sold for steel.  But dont forget to look inside for copper wiring.Small appliances such as coffee makers, AC units, fans, blenders and toasters may all have copper wiring inside.Small electronics, such as cell phones, cameras and hand-held games are good places to search for copper wire.\n",
            "Search construction and remodeling sites.\n",
            "Electricians scrape up electrical wire for scrap during demolition.  Plumbing materials also contain copper and brass.  Always check with the owner or a construction supervisor before taking copper away from a property that you do not own.  Even if you are being paid to clean a demolition site, that does not give you a claim to the wire or any other materials you find there. [38]\n",
            "Look for copper in your home.\n",
            "Look for old statues or dcor.  Old garden gnomes, statues and other lawn ornaments may contain copper.  In addition, sometimes roofing material is made from copper sheeting.  Roofing copper is recyclable and environmentally friendly.[39]\n",
            "Understand the consequences of copper theft.\n",
            "Unless you have permission to remove copper from a property you do not own, it is considered theft.  Copper theft has been on the rise since the value of copper started to increase in 2004.CNBC refers to copper theft as an epidemic that is sweeping the United States.[40]The FBI states that copper theft is threatening the infrastructure of the United States.  Thieves are targeting electrical sub-stations, cellular towers, telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction sites, and vacant homes.  Delivery of electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and security and emergency services is disrupted.  This poses a threat to public safety and national security.[41]Businesses are taking steps to protect themselves from copper theft.  They are installing security cameras, securing metals in locked areas, installing alarms, limiting access to buildings and increasing lighting.[42]In many states, the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony has to do with the value of items stolen.  Since copper is so valuable, copper thieves are often charged with a felony when caught.  Also, since copper thieves can knock out traffic lights or disrupt 911 services, other felony charges such as disrupting public service may be filed.\n",

            "Have you already talked to your parents about boarding school? What were their major concerns about letting you attend boarding school? Did they have any questions? Before you talk to your parents again (or for the first time), take time to research several boarding schools.As you research, write down facts and statistics that will answer their questions and find solutions to their concerns.Write down facts about class sizes, teaching methods, number of student borders, extracurricular opportunities, sports teams, tuition, and location.[1]\n",
            "Prepare for the entrance tests.\n",
            "In order to apply to boarding school, you must take the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT) or the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE). To perform well on these challenging tests, you must study and prepare for the evaluations. Studying for these exams before your parents agree to let you take them will show them that you are serious about commitment to attending boarding.The SSAT tests students in grades 3 through 12. It costs approximately $120.00.[2]The ISEE tests students in grades 2 through 12. It costs between $105.00 to $185.00. There are fee waivers available.[3]\n",
            "Think about the cost of boarding school.\n",
            "Boarding schools are expensive. The cost of private education causes many parents say \"no\" to boarding school. In addition to paying tuition, students and their families must cover the cost of room and board and travel expenses. Before you talk to your parents, spend time brainstorming how you could help fund your private education. Coming up with a creative solution may help convince them to let you attend boarding school.Do the schools you are interested in offer scholarships and financial aid packages?Do you qualify for need or merit based aid?Are there independent scholarships you can apply for and receive?Are you able to work while you attend school?Will the cost of your current extracurricular activities (private music lessons, sports clubs, dance classes) offset the cost of boarding school?[4]\n",

            "Many boarding schools have outstanding athletic programs. Since their teams can afford to compete around the nation and world, their student athletes are more likely to play in front of recruiters from high ranking college programs. They also offer a variety of sports that are not available at every public school, such as squash and equestrian. As you talk with your parents, mention that:You want to train and compete at a high level.Playing for this school will help you get recruited by a Division I college or university.[7]\n",

            "Wash the area with salt water.\n",
            "Stingray stings are one of the most common significant injuries on tropical and warm water beaches and reefs.[1] If you are stung, you'll very likely be in salt water, so it'll be easy to rinse the injury out before attempting anything else. The salt water will wash away any debris and help sanitize/clean your wound from any bacteria that may have been introduced into it or around it.The pain from a stingray sting is sharp and excruciating, so it may be difficult to keep calm and think clearly. So before running out of the water, take a few seconds to clean around the puncture wound.The most common areas to be stung by stingrays are the foot and lower leg. Your upper body and arms are the second-most common areas.\n",
            "Remove the stinger with tweezers.\n",
            "Usually the stinger stays attached to the tail of a stingray when it attacks, but sometimes it will stay stuck in the wound. The size of stingers depends on the size of the stingray, but most are a little smaller and shorter than knitting needles  which is still a significant size to be punctured with. As long as the stinger isn't very large and stuck through an internal organ or major artery, it's best to quickly remove it with tweezers or by a steady hand while wearing thick rubber gloves.[2] Most stingers produce poisonous venom, so be careful handling them.Removing a stinger can be more painful in the short-term because of its serrated edges tearing tissue as you pull it out. However, removing it quickly may prevent more venom from getting into your wound, which is beneficial in the longer term.Pulling out a stinger will also cause more blood to seep out of the wound for a few minutes, but it can help flush out any debris and bacteria. Be sure to rinse it in more sea water to help clean it.Pulling out a stinger from an organ or major artery may trigger massive and fatal bleeding, so in these circumstances leave it in and seek medical attention as quick as you can.\n",
            "Soak the wound in hot water.\n",
            "The most helpful thing you can do to combat the painful effects of the venom is to submerge your injury (preferably with the stinger removed) in hot water. The ideal temperature for the water is about 110 F or so, but soak the wound in water as hot as you can tolerate it without burning your skin.[3] The hot water denatures (destroys) the protein in the venom, which renders it harmless, and the heat also helps to sanitize the wound. Soak your wound for between 30-90 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the water.[4]Additional symptoms caused by the venom include: swollen lymph nodes near the wound, difficulty breathing, elevated heart rate, reduced blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, muscle cramps, headache, fainting, and/or seizures.[5]Be sure to test hot water for young children first before you soak their wounds in hot water.The area around the puncture wound will swell and turn dark red, sometimes with a bluish tint.Although the pain from the sting is most immediate and typically peaks in 1-2 hours, the symptoms from the venom can escalate over 2 days. You may notice swelling or discoloration around the sting, but more severe symptoms could include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, headache, seizures, or necrosis.[6]\n",
            "Take over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatories.\n",
            "Some of the pain related to a stingray's sting is due to swelling of the puncture wound. Therefore, taking an OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful to reduce some discomfort in the short term.[7] Painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) can be used for the pain of stings too, but they don't impact the swelling.Anti-inflammatories and analgesics (painkillers) should be considered short-term strategies for pain control while you get to the nearest hospital or walk-in clinic and receive medical attention.If you are bleeding profusely from the stingray's puncture wound, then take acetaminophen for some pain relief instead of NSAIDs because they tend to \"thin\" the blood and reduce your body's clotting ability.\n",
            "Get medical attention.\n",
            "Although basic first aid, hot water, and anti-inflammatories are certainly helpful, a wound from a stingray almost always needs medical attention.[8] Before calling 9-1-1 or going to the emergency department, it's best to determine the person's age, weight, and condition, as well as the time of the sting, so the doctors can assess the potential seriousness of the situation. A smaller person (child) has a much greater risk of serious complications from the venom than a larger person.For immediate pain control, the doctor will likely inject a local anesthetic into and around the wound. Nerve blocks can also be used.Oral antibiotics may be given to prevent infection if the wound is deep or there is a significant delay in seeking treatment. Your doctor may also give opioids for severe pain.The wound will be thoroughly cleaned, although stitches may not be applied until the doctor is confident that there's a great risk of infection. You also might get a tetanus shot.If the stinger is venomous (not all are) antiserum medication will be given to reverse the side effects of the venom.Your doctor also might want to do x-rays or another form of imaging to make sure that there are no barbs that are still stuck in your skin and to assess any internal damage that could have been done by penetrating barbs.If someone was stung in the chest or abdomen, consider getting an EKG and lab work so your doctor can monitor your cardiac activity. If theyre concerned about more severe side effects, like shock, theyll transfer you somewhere with an ICU.[9]\n",
            "Don't swim with stingrays.\n",
            "Although stingrays tend to be non-aggressive creatures who try to avoid or escape from people, some larger species may confuse people as prey or as hostile threats.[10] \"Crocodile Hunter\" Steve Irwin died as a result of a stingray attack back in 2006, even though he thought he was safe. He was punctured multiple times through the lungs and heart and died shortly thereafter from the wounds. Thus, the best prevention for avoiding stings is to never knowingly swim with them and avoid areas/beaches that are considered their habitat.Talk to local fishermen or surfers who are familiar with the coastlines and beaches about what areas to avoid.Don't touch dead stingrays. The stingers obviously remain sharp after death, but venom can still be secreted from them also, so don't pick one up.If youre fishing and catch a stingray, cut it from the line rather than trying to untangle it.Avoid swimming too close to the seafloor since a stingray could easily reach you.[11]\n",
            "Shuffle your feet while you walk.\n",
            "If you have no intention of avoiding tropical and temperate beaches, then you should learn how to minimize the risk of stepping on a stingray. The best technique seems to be to slide or shuffle your feet through the sand instead of lifting your feet and taking steps.[12] The stingrays detect this from a distance and swim away before you have a chance to accidentally step on them.Stamping on the bottom as you slowly tread through murky water can also scare stingrays off from a distance.You can also use a pole to poke the sand ahead of you before taking a step forward.[13]Wearing footwear while in the water doesn't really make a difference in preventing a stingray injury. The stingers can easily penetrate rubber and nylon material.\n",
            "Identify poisonous species.\n",
            "If you're scuba diving or snorkeling, learn to identify poisonous and/or aggressive species of stingrays (and other sea creatures) beforehand.[14] The internet is full of information and colorful pictures to help you identify the different species of rays. Some, such as the manta ray, have no stinger and are harmless to people. Before going on a tropical beach holiday, prepare yourself and your family with this helpful info.Learning the general habits of the local species while on vacation can keep you from getting into risky situations. Stingray injuries often occur in late summer and early fall, when they burrow in the sand in shallow surf.While most stingrays live in salt water, there are a few freshwater species that have venom thats more toxic.[15]Avoid going to remote areas that are isolated from medical help. The profuse bleeding and venom can be life-threatening if medical help is delayed by more than a few hours.\n",

            "Act cool and stay aloof.\n",
            "Sasuke is calm, cold, indifferent, cruel, cynical, a bit sarcastic and somewhat arrogant.[2] In other words, hes got a cool superiority about him that comes from his confidence and power. If you want to act like Sasuke, you want to exude a sense of that superiority.[3]In general, when people approach you, don't give the time of day, even if it's your best friend, or a romantic interest. They are so much below you in skill and knowledge, you should act like you're bored by their presence.\n",
            "Keep a chip on your shoulder.\n",
            "Sasuke has something to prove, and always seems to be dwelling on some inferiority complex. Hes unwilling to acknowledge when someone is stronger than him, and obsesses when it becomes clear that he may be outmatched. Start cultivating a grim and serious demeanor. Go on long contemplative walks like Sasuke does. Scowl while you do it.Try to stop laughing at jokes, or at little trifles. Sasuke is deadly serious at all times, making it important that you focus on the gravity of life and the most important things. No time for jokes!\n",
            "Be smart.\n",
            "You are smart, and you know it. Show people that you are smarter than them. Sasuke is hailed as a genius, even by the battle-adept Uchiha clan's standards, excelling at all that he does and finding little difficulty in more challenging tasks. Try to learn everything easily, and be the top on your class.Study hard, especially the serious subjects like history and literature. Study the great works and commit to being a warrior monk, able to quote poetry at length and do battle in equal measure.\n",
            "Be quiet.\n",
            "Sasuke rarely talks, but when he does, he keeps it brief and to the point. Start buttoning up some and you might notice the same thing happen. If you're less likely to talk, when you do choose to speak, make sure it's to the point and serious, and you'll quickly get a reputation as a person to be listened to.When you do speak, speak clearly and confidently and make pauses between sentences, for more effect. You must not look uncertain when you speak, just say what you mean and mean what you say. Don't stop in the middle or start fading your voice. Confidence shows that whatever you are talking you mean it.\n",

            "Difficult challenges, easy tasks, big goals: whatever you've got on your plate, try to do it yourself without asking for help from others. Sasuke views help as a sign of weakness, and wants very much to be seen as a leader, like someone who is to be trusted, and capable. He does not take orders kindly, a sign of his self-reliance.Don't look to others to validate your pride and your confidence in yourself. Sasuke's favorite word is \"power\" (, chikara). So, try to gain it, in everything you stumble upon. Find your inner light and your inner strength and use that as your source of confidence, not the opinions of others. Please yourself.Be sexy. You have a load of self-confidence and you show it. Be yourself and definitely don't flirt with that goofball blonde.\n",

            "Sasuke has a classic manga hair style, with long emo-like bangs in the front and spiked hair in the back. Grow your hair out a bit, if it's short, to give yourself more to work with, and practice spiking your hair with mousse or hairspray. It'll take a considerable amount of product to get your hair to look like Sasuke's is drawn.If you want a slightly tamer version, keep your hair short in the back and grow out your bangs, sweeping them to the side of your face.

What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to restore my clan, and destroy a certain someone.\"\"If you think I'm just a foolish kid ruled by his emotions, that's fine. Following Itachi's path would be childish, the whispering of fools who don't know hatred. If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I'll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they'll understand what it's like to taste a little of my hatred.\"There is no question that you are special... unfortunately you're not quite as special as I am!\"\"With my hatred ... I'll turn the illusion into reality!\"\"I am on a path the rest of you can't follow... \"\"I have long since closed my eyes... My only goal is in the darkness.\"\n",
            "How to File Your Nails Like a Pro: Step-by-Step Guide\n",
            "Thoroughly wash and dry your hands with soap and warm water.\n",
            "Before you get filing nails, cleanse your hands to get rid of any oil or debris that might interfere with the process. Wet your hands with warm water, then lather them in soap for at least 20 seconds.[1] Spend an extra minute or so rubbing soap onto your nails (and underneath them) with the tips of your fingers. Then, dry your hands with a clean towel.Filing while your nails are still wet can make them more prone to breakage or rough edges, so make sure theyre totally dry before you continue.\n",
            "Choose a soft-grit nail file.\n",
            "While there are several types of nail files you can choose, emery board files are both affordable and effective. Use a file with a softer grit of around 180-200 for the smoothest filing experience and to keep the edges of your nails from looking rough or scraggly.[2]Only use coarse grits, around 80-100, with acrylic nails. These grits are too harsh for natural nails, and might result in damage.Also avoid metal files, which arent very gentle and are more difficult to control. On the other hand, glass or crystal files are very effective and can be easily cleaned in the dishwasher.While its not recommended, 200-grit or above sandpaper works in a pinch. For best results, wrap and tape it around a sturdy object, like a wooden block or a ruler.\n",
            "Decide on your nail shape.\n",
            "There are many nail shapes to choose from, but some of the most popular and basic shapes are oval, square, and almond.[3] Whichever shape you choose is totally up to you, so pick whichever speaks to you and go with it! You can always go with a different shape next time.Oval-shaped nails are a great shape for maintaining long nails, since your nails will be least likely to break off in this shape. Oval-shaped nails are symmetrically round at the tip and offer an elongated, feminine look.[4]Square-shaped nails are a great statement look and work well with people who have both long or short nails, so choose this shape if youre still growing your nails out. The square shape comes from filing the nail straight at the tip all the way across the nail.Squoval nails are somewhere between oval and square nails, with an elongated, slightly squared curve. These are perhaps the easiest to execute and look great on any hand, so go with these if youre unsure.Almond-shaped nails are great for making your fingers look more slender. They feature a narrow curve at the end that resemblesyou guessed itan almond.Coffin nails have recently become more popular. These nails are long and narrow out toward the end, with a squared-off tip. They combine edge and elegance, and look absolutely striking with black polish.Stiletto nails narrow into a sharp point at the end, making for a sharp and distinct look. Much respect if you decide to go for thesejust be careful not to hurt yourself after youre finished.\n",
            "Trim your nails to the general desired shape before you begin.\n",
            "Start by cutting your nails down into the basic shape youre aiming for. For example, if you want the squoval shape, use nail trimmers to cut straight across the end of your nails, so you can round out the corners later.[5] Do the same for square nails. If your nails are relatively short, however, skip this step so that you have more nail to work with.For round or oval nails, make 4-5 smaller cuts at the end of each nail to get the curved shape started.If youre aiming for almond, coffin, or stiletto nails, cut down the sides of your nails more than the tip, so that they become narrow toward the ends.\n",
            "Hold the file perpendicular to the edge of the nail.\n",
            "Start by holding the file so that the surface touches your nail straight-on. Use this angle as you get the basic shape of the nail worked out. Also, position your hands so that your fingers point toward you, rather than away, to help you better see your work. Then, if youre filing rounded nails, gradually transition to holding the file so that its slightly tilted under your nail, so you can more easily achieve a curved edge.[6]Try not to file at a tilted angle until the end of your session to avoid needlessly thinning out and weakening your nail.If your nails are already thin or bend easily, avoid filing at an angle at all.\n",
            "File in single strokes along the grain of your nail.\n",
            "Many beginners tend to use a sawing motion when they file, but this can lead to tears or breakages. Instead, use smooth strokes in a single direction, filing down the length of the nail more often than up toward your fingers. As you finish the stroke, lift the file away from the nail, then go in for another, separate stroke.[7]Remember that youll make hundreds of individual strokes in the process of filing and shaping your nails, so be conscious of your form, and keep at it!\n",
            "File most shapes from the edges toward the center.\n",
            "For rounded or pointed shapes, start by filing the outside edges of your nail, and work your way toward the center. This allows for a smooth and gradual curve. Then, for a coffin nail, file perpendicular at the very tip to create that squared end. For squared nails, though, start filing perpendicular to the tip until you have a flat end, then only file the outside edges slightly to smooth them out.[8]As you work on rounded shapes, alternate filing either side of the nail to ensure a smooth and symmetrical curve. For example, file 10 strokes on one side, and 10 strokes on the other.For stiletto nails, focus only on filing the sides of the nail into straight lines that meet at the end. Then, file down the very tip to make it slightly blunt, so you dont accidentally cause injuries.\n",
            "Finish your first nail, then use it as a model for the others.\n",
            "Once youve gotten the first nail into the shape you like, go to the next nail and follow the same process, continuing on to each nail until all are complete. As you do, compare each nail to the first, and view them from multiple angles to make sure youre on track.[9]While you work, use your file to flick away any shavings that have built up underneath the nail, or use your nail to do the same for shavings that build up on the file. Keeping a tidy tool helps get the best results!Also, dont file your nail past the tip of your finger, which may cause injury to your finger or damage to the nail.\n",
            "Buff your nails to give them a smooth finish.\n",
            "Buffing your nails smooths out the ridges and gives natural nails a shiny gloss.[10] To buff your nails, hold a buffing block parallel to the top of your nail and, just like when you were filing, pull it across the top of the nail in unidirectional strokes. Only use 6-8 strokes per nail to avoid thinning or weakening them.\n",
            "Apply cuticle oil to moisturize the skin on your nails.\n",
            "Cuticle oil helps keep your cuticlesthe skin that overlaps your nailshealthy and clean. Keeping your cuticles moisturized also helps prevent hangnails.[11] Apply a drop of cuticle oil to each nail, wait 1-2 minutes for it to absorb into your nail and skin, then dab off the excess with a paper towel.Keep cuticle oil and moisturizer next to the soap at your sink as a reminder to apply it every few days.\n",
            "Apply nail polish and file your nails every couple of weeks.\n",
            "Now youre ready to  paint your nails however you like. Just remember to  remove the polish every week or so, then file your bare nails every couple of weeks to keep them in shape.[12]Avoid filing your nails more than once a week, which can weaken or damage them. Its important to let them grow a bit!\n",

            "Start with a fresh skin.\n",
            "Before you can cure a snakeskin, it needs to have already been removed from the snake in one piece. Make sure you take the necessary safety precautions when working with skinning tools, such as knives and calipers, and with intact specimens.[1]A pair of rugged work gloves will keep your hands clean and protect you from mishaps.Even a dead snake can be dangerous if handled improperly.\n",
            "Remove any remaining tissue from the snakeskin.\n",
            "Use the edge of a knife to slice or scrape away excess flesh and connective tissue. For best results, rest the blade at a 45 degree angle against the inner membrane and drag it along slowly to loosen whatever's stuck on it. Be careful not to use too much force, or you may damage the delicate scales.A knife with a slightly dulled edge may work better than one thats overly sharp, like an X-acto knife or razor blade.Theres no need to strip every last piece of tissue you encounter. The little bit thats left can be peeled off with ease once the snakeskin has been dried.\n",
            "Lay the snakeskin flat on an appropriate drying surface.\n",
            "Whatever surface you choose should be large enough to unfurl the entire length of the skin. It should also be completely level and soft enough to pierce with staples or pushpins, which youll use to fasten the skin and ensure that it dries flat.Depending on the size of the snake youre working with and the place where youre doing your drying, you might use a cutting board, a sheet of plywood or even a scrap of cardboard.\n",
            "Flatten the snakeskin by hand.\n",
            "Stretch the skin out on the drying surface scale-side down and use both hands to gently smooth the curled edges as best you can. Apply constant pressure to the skin with the palm of your hand until it begins to lay down on its own.Generally, the fresher the skin is, the more pliable it will be.Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before handling the snakeskin. This will keep it from sticking to you.\n",
            "Tack down the snakeskin along the edges.\n",
            "Go down the length of the skin and staple or stick in push pins to hold it in place. Insert a staple or pin every  to 1 (1.25-2.5cm)obviously, a larger specimen will require more fasteners. Keep in mind that snakeskin tends to curl up as it dries, so any edges you leave free may cause imperfections in the finished skin.[2]It may help to place a weighted object at one or both ends of the skin as you secure it to the drying surface.Dont forget to staple the head and tail segments, as well.\n",
            "Place a thin mesh screen over the snakeskin.\n",
            "The screen will press the skin flat and discourage curling in the center. Choose a lightweight screen with openings small enough to fit tightly over the entire area of the stretched skin, but still large enough to promote airflow.If youre using push pins or similar fasteners, you may have to put the screen in position before tacking it down over the snakeskin.A drying screen isn't a strict necessity, but it may produce better results than pinning or stapling alone.\n",
            "Secure the screen to the drying surface.\n",
            "Use your remaining pins or staples to fasten the corners, sides and any other loose spots. This will prevent it from drifting out of place.You might also try tying down the screen instead for ease of removal later on.\n",
            "Store the snakeskin in a cool, dry place.\n",
            "While the skin is drying, keep it away from excess moisture or direct sunlight. In most cases, a basement, garage or workshop will provide the best setting, but you could also use any interior room of your home as long as it stays at a steady temperature.Humid conditions may increase drying time or interfere with the snakeskins ability to cure.Avoid storing dried snakeskins near the bathroom or kitchen, where there may be high levels of moisture in the air.\n",
            "Leave the snakeskin to dry for 1-3 days.\n",
            "It will begin to dehydrate naturally as it sits. Avoid handling it in the meantime. Within a few days, the snakeskin will take on a delicate leathery texture, at which point it can be used for crafting, decoration or another purpose.[3]Snakeskins will cure faster in warm, temperate climates. Those who live in a cold or wet region should plan on an additional day or two of drying time.The drying process will also help neutralize the odor thats present when the skin is fresh.\n",
            "Remove the snakeskin from the drying surface.\n",
            "Lift away the screen, then pull out each of the staples or pins you used to attach the snakeskin. Take your time and work carefully to avoid cracking or tearing. Once dried, the snakeskin may become brittle and easily damaged.If the snakeskin sticks to the drying surface, run a flat instrument (like the blade of a knife or a metal ruler) underneath from one end to the other to free it.\n",
            "Use the snakeskin for a crafting or decorating project.\n",
            "Dried snakeskins can be turned into clothing and accessories such as shoes, vests and wallets, as well as inlays for various other materials. They can also simply be hung as a decoration. The finished piece will feature a dazzling pattern that's not only attractive but completely natural.When making homemade crafts, it's best to start preparing the snakeskin while it's still fresh. That way, it will be at its strongest and most lustrous and won't have time to begin rotting.Fashioning items from snakeskins that you've stripped and dried yourself is far less expensive than buying overpriced snakeskin clothing in stores.\n",

            "Choose a long piece of wood for the bow.\n",
            "There are a few things to consider when selecting raw wood for your bow:[1]Find a piece of dry and dead (but not gray or cracking) hardwood (such as oak, lemon tree, hickory, yew, black locust, teak, ash, juniper, or madroo) about 6 feet (or 1.8 meters) [or as tall as you may be] in length.  The wood should be free of knots, twists, or limbs, and it would be helpful if the branch is thick at its center.This piece of wood should be somewhat flexible, such as juniper or mulberry. You can even use a shaft of bamboo or cane but take care that it is not too thick. For that, you can use young bamboo which is strong as well as flexible.Green wood (living wood that you cut from a tree or sapling) can be used if absolutely necessary but should be avoided because it does not provide the same power as dry wood.\n",
            "Determine the natural curve of the stick.\n",
            "Every piece of wood will have a natural curve, no matter how slight.  As you construct the bow, this curve will determine where you place its main features. To find the curve, place your wood on the ground, with one hand holding it in place at the top. With your other hand, press lightly against its middle. It will swivel so that its natural belly faces you, and its back faces out.[2]\n",
            "Determine the handhold and limbs.\n",
            "These parts are essential to the shaping process. To find the handhold, make marks three inches above and below the center point of the bow. Anything within these marks is the handhold, above them is the upper limb, and below is the lower limb.[3]\n",
            "Shape the bow.\n",
            "Place the bottom end of the bow on your foot, and one hand atop the bow. With your other hand, press outward, the belly facing you. Use this exercise to catalog where the bow is flexible and where it is not. Using a knife or similar tool, shave wood off the unyielding spots on the belly only, until both the upper and lower limbs curve similarly to each other. Check your progress frequently. When both limbs are more flexible and are mirror images of each other in curve and diameter, you are ready for the next step.[4]You want the bow to be strongest (thickest) at the handhold.Be careful to only carve from the belly. An inordinate amount of pressure is exerted on the back of the bow, and even the slightest damage to its structure can promote breakage.\n",
            "Cut notches to hold the bow string.\n",
            "Use your knife to cut notches that begin at the sides and curve around toward the belly of the bow and in toward the handhold as they go. There should be one on each side about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from each end of the bow. Remember not to cut into its back, and do not make the notches deep enough to compromise the strength of the tips. Make them just deep enough to hold the string in place.\n",
            "Select a bow string.\n",
            "The string should not be stretchy, as the power comes from the wood, not the string. If you are stranded in the wilderness, it may be difficult to find a suitable string, and you may need to try a variety of materials before you find one that has the necessary strength. Some bowstring material possibilities are:[5]rawhidethin nylon ropehemp cordfishing linestrands of cotton or silk from caterpillarsordinary twine\n",
            "String the bow\n",
            ". You will need to tie a loose loop with a very secure knot at both ends of your bowstring before slipping it over the lower, and then upper, limb of your bow. Make your string slightly shorter than the length of your unflexed bow, so that both bow and string are taut.\n",
            "Tiller the bow.\n",
            "Hang it upside down by the handhold from a tree branch or something similar so that you can pull downward on the string. Pull downward slowly, checking to make sure that the limbs bend evenly and carving away wood as required, until you can pull it as far down as the distance between your hand and your jaw (arm fully extended out from shoulder).[6]\n",
            "Select sticks for arrows.\n",
            "Arrows should be formed from the straightest sticks you can find. The wood should be dry and dead.  Each arrow should be about half as long as the bow, or as long as the bow can draw back.  It does not work to have arrows that can't be pulled back to the bow's potential. Consider these items as well:Green wood does work if you can give it some extra time to dry out naturally, as the sap may ignite if placed over a fire to dry.Some strong, straight plants for arrows are goldenrod and Mullen . They can be found in fields.\n",
            "Shape the arrows.\n",
            "You will need to whittle the wood smooth around the circumference of the arrow.  You can straighten an arrow by gently heating the shaft over hot coals--do not scorch or burn the wood--and then holding the arrow straight while the wood cools. Carve a small notch in the back tip of each arrow to accommodate the bow string. This is called a nock.\n",

            "The simplest arrowhead is simply a carved point on the front of the arrow shaft.  You can whittle such a point with a knife and then fire harden it by gently heating it in coals (again, be careful not to burn or scorch the wood).\n",
            "Construct an arrowhead if possible.\n",
            "(This is optional). You can do this with metal, stone, glass, or bone. Carefully use a small rock or hammer to chip your material into a point and attach it to the arrow's tip. You can do this by notching the wood, inserting the arrowhead into the notch, and then lashing the arrowhead to the wood with some sort of string or cord.[7]\n",
            "Make fletchings (optional).\n",
            "While fletchings improve the arrow's flight, they are not necessary for a field-expedient weapon. Find some feathers to make the fletchings and glue them (if possible) onto the back ends of the arrows. You could also split the back of the arrow, slide the feather in, and tightly wrap a thin thread (possibly obtained from your own clothes) around the fletching. If you use this method, you can use just about anything as your fletching.[8]Fletchings act similarly to rudders on a ship or small plane, guiding the arrow through the air for pinpoint accuracy.They also have a similar effect to a glider, as they vastly improve an arrow's range of flight.They are, however, somewhat difficult to perfect. If your weapon is meant for survival, this is not a priority.\n",

            "Purchase a package of natto at an Asian supermarket near you.\n",
            "Natto is relatively inexpensive to buy, and can be purchased for as little as $0.89 USD (0.77 Euro) or as much as $3.00 USD (2.58 Euro). It is typically offered in small, round single packs, or bundled into 3 medium, square packages.[2]Natto is a refrigerated item and can spoil. Make sure to check the expiration date before purchasing.[3]\n",
            "Choose between a large, medium, and small soybean size.\n",
            "The different types of natto are usually distinguished by the soybeans size, variety, and processing method. Recipes including natto do not typically specify the soybean size, so pick one that you think you will enjoy eating the most. Large soybeans will give you a bigger bite of the fermented flavor and sticky texture, while smaller soybeans can mix more subtly with rice and other dishes.[4]The packaging may not indicate the bean size directly, but the small bean is the one that is most commercially used. If you purchase a package of natto, it will most likely use the small to medium bean variety. The larger beans are traditionally black or red soybeans. If the packaging mentions using either of those, then know that the soybean size will be large.Natto is also offered as a spread. Hikiwari natto involves pulverizing the soybeans prior to fermenting them. If you are considering using the natto as a spread, pick up some hikiwari natto instead of the traditional natto.[5]\n",
            "Take off the packing lid, and remove the two sauce packets.\n",
            "There will be a small arrow on one of the corners of the lid to indicate where to open it. Pre-made natto containers usually come with a small packet of tare, or sweetened soy sauce, and a spicy Japanese mustard that you can use to mix with your natto. You are not obligated to use these sauces, but both will complement the natto nicely. Make sure to keep the lid of the packaging nearby as it will give you a place to rest the sticky packaging film later on.[6]\n",
            "Tear off the clear film from the packaging to expose the natto.\n",
            "Natto is extremely gooey, so if you arent careful with taking off the clear film, you can wind up with sticky hands really quickly. Common methods of removing the film are by pinching the center of the film, or by carefully sliding the film off.[7]Pinch the center of the clear film, and slowly lift it away from the natto. As you lift the film, move your hand in circles over the container. This will help gather the sticky strings from the natto that have stuck to the film. Once the strings are contained, rest the clear film on the lid of the packaging. This method of removing the packaging is often referred to as the tornado method because of the circling motion you make with your hand.For the slide method, grab an edge of the clear film, and slide it until it overhangs one side of the container. Put the lid back on the container, and pull the film out through the seam.\n",
            "Use a spoon or chopsticks to thoroughly mix the natto.\n",
            "The natto will be hard to stir at first, but will eventually soften and loosen. Don't be alarmed if the mixture begins to turn white or develop bubbles, as this is normal for the natto as it aerates. Stop mixing the natto when you have reached a consistency you are satisfied with. Most recommendations are to stir the natto in one direction to avoid spilling it, and to stir it for at least 50 turns or 60 seconds.[8]\n",
            "Mix in the packets of soy sauce and mustard for a simple flavoring.\n",
            "People prefer to eat natto without cooking to get its full health benefit. [9] You can squeeze in as much or as little of both sauces as you want. Just make sure to thoroughly mix in the sauces before eating it. Try adding the sauces before your initial stirring of the natto. Some people claim that the natto is more flavorful and less slimy if you add the soy sauce and mustard, and then only thoroughly stir the natto once.[10]Instead of the sauce packets, you can add some of your favorite sauces as well. Experiment by adding sriracha to give the natto some heat, or add teriyaki sauce to make the natto tangy and sweet.[11]\n",
            "Use vinegar to reduce the bold smell and taste of the natto.\n",
            "Just adding 12 teaspoons (4.99.9mL) of vinegar to the natto will help round out the smell and flavors. Rice vinegar will mellow the natto, but wont add any noticeable flavors. Balsamic vinegar will pair nicely with the natto, and add extra flavor to it.[12]A few drops of sesame oil will also add flavor to the natto, and reduce the smell.[13]\n",
            "Add diced green onions and eggs for a traditional Japanese taste.\n",
            "While it is custom to eat a raw egg or a raw egg yolk with the natto, you can recreate a similar experience with a poached, over-easy, or sunny-side up egg instead. The gooeyness of the egg yolk and the crunch from the green onions will mellow and round out the unique flavor of the natto.[14]Other standard toppings that pair nicely with the green onions and eggs include sesame seeds for an added crunch; katsuobushi or bonito flakes, which is dried, fermented, and smoked skipjack tuna; and kimchi, which is Napa cabbage or Korean radishes seasoned with chili powder, scallions, garlic, and ginger.[15]\n",
            "Heat the natto to soften the texture and bring out the natural flavors.\n",
            "If you dont enjoy the texture of the cold natto, try eating it warm. Rest the lid on the container, and place it in the microwave for 20 seconds, and then stir the mixture to redistribute the heat. Hot or warm natto will have a stronger smell, but some people have found that the heat also enhances the flavors of the fermented soybeans.[16]Make sure to remove the clear film before warming the natto in the microwave. The thin plastic of the film may melt when heated.\n",
            "Pair natto with plain white rice for a simple traditional Japanese dish.\n",
            "You can either eat the natto and white rice plain, or you can add additional seasonings and toppings.[17] If you choose to season the natto, do so before adding it to the rice to make mixing the flavors easier.Consider adding the complimentary packets of soy sauce or mustard, or adding chopped green onion, and a cooked egg for a quick breakfast dish.Instead of white rice, add natto to your favorite pasta shape to create a mixed noodle salad.[18] Mix in some chopped green onions and bell peppers to round out the flavors.[19]Make a stir-fry using fried brown rice and natto. Add chunks of roasted pork, chopped carrots, and even scrambled eggs.\n",
            "Mix up a natto salad to create a filling lunch.\n",
            "Pick bold flavors that will either contrast the fermented taste like perilla leaves, which are of the mint variety and have notes of anise or licorice, or pick subtle flavors as found in sweet, earthy root vegetables. How much of an ingredient you add is completely up to your taste and texture preferences.[20]For hearty, tangy salad, mix ingredients like wasabi, your favorite shredded cheese like cheddar or pepper-jack, mayonnaise, nori (seaweed), pickled plums, and perilla leaves. Season the salad with some black pepper to taste, and dice up some cooked tuna for added protein.[21]For a light and refreshing taste, marinate your prepared natto with shredded root vegetables like carrots, beets, kelp, and daikon, which is a mild-flavored winter radish; seaweed soaked in rice vinegar; mirin, which is a tangy, sweet rice wine; and sesame oil for 30 minutes. Before serving, give the salad a final stir to redistribute the stickiness of the natto, and enjoy.[22]\n",
            "Make natto toast if you are looking for a quick snack.\n",
            "This is a simple snack that can be eaten plain, or dressed up with other toppings. And if you throw on some cheese, and a second slice of toasted bread, you can even turn it into a grilled cheese sandwich.[23]Toast up your favorite type of bread like a classic white bread or a hearty whole grain for an extra crunch. Thick slices of bread work better than thin ones. The natto and any other toppings you add can easily oversaturate or become too heavy for thinner pieces of bread.Spoon your desired amount of natto onto the bread. This is a good time to use the hikiwari natto that is spreadable, but you can just as easily cover the toast with normal natto as well.For added sweetness or texture, drizzle on some honey, or sprinkle cheese on the toast while it is still hot.\n",
            "Cook the natto on the stovetop with eggs for an omelet packed with protein.\n",
            "A standard package of natto can be cooked with 1 to 3 eggs depending on the ratio you want. Then get creative and add more complementary ingredients like cheese, spinach, or green onions, either into the egg mixture or on top of the cooked omelet.[24]\n",
            "Top your favorite meat with natto for added texture.\n",
            "Natto doesnt just go well with eggs; it actually nicely complements just about any cut of meat. Try pairing the natto with slices of grilled chicken, or chunks of pork that is seasoned with sesame oil and ginger. If you are feeling adventurous, mix some barbeque sauce in with the natto, and spoon the mixture onto slices of seared steak. The warmth of the meat will melt the natto mixture into a thin glaze.[25]As a side dish to cooked salmon, mix the natto with kale, tamari, and lemon juice. These neutral flavors will meld together, and the lemon juice will help cut the bold taste of the natto.[26]\n",

            "Drink plenty of water before entering the bath.\n",
            "You'll be doing a lot of sweating in a short space of time in the steam bath and this can cause dehydration. Drink a couple of glasses of water before your steam bath to ensure you don't get dehydrated.[1]Wash your body rigorously. Make sure you get all the dirt out from your pores. Dirt on your body can block your pores and you could develop acne or spots. Blocked pores will prevent your body from efficiently secreting toxins.\n",
            "Avoid food for an hour before your bath.\n",
            "Much the same reasoning applies here as it does to not eating for an hour before going for a swim. Eating might make you feel bloated and might mess with your digestion, so it's best to avoid food for as long as you can before your bath.[2]If you must eat, eat something like light snacks or fruits.\n",
            "Stretch your body before the bath.\n",
            "Do some light stretching to loosen up and to help your body release some of the toxins from your pores. Stretching will also increase circulation which will help toxins leave your skin faster through sweat.[3]\n",
            "Take a shower.\n",
            "Showering before a steam bath will help your body find its natural temperature, which will make the steam bath more effective. A warm shower is better than a cold shower but make sure your shower isn't too hot, you don't want to start sweating yet.[4]\n",
            "Wear a light cotton towel.\n",
            "For your steam bath to be most effective, the less clothes you wear going into the steam bath, the better. The more exposed you are, the easier it will be for your body to sweat out the toxins.[5]No jewellery or glasses either. The towel should be the only thing you wear.\n",
            "Ensure you have enough time to fully relax.\n",
            "Do not rush your steam bath. Try not to schedule your bath before appointments or other errands.You should be able to focus on relaxing and enjoying the bath.Turn off your phone or leave it in a secure location where it won't disturb you.\n",
            "Relax in the bath.\n",
            "It's up to you to decide whether you want to sit down or lie down in the bath. The most important thing though is that you relax and enjoy the process. Clear your mind of your stresses and problems and enjoy the time you spend in the steam room.\n",
            "Close your eyes and focus on your breathing.\n",
            "For maximum relaxation and enjoyment, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, holding your breath in between for a few seconds. With your eyes closed, you can focus on your other senses and concentrating on your breathing is a great way to relax and de-stress.\n",
            "Drink plenty of water during the bath.\n",
            "Bring a bottle of water with you into the steam room. With such high temperatures in the steam room, you'll be sweating much more than normal and therefore your body will be losing moisture faster than normal.[6]Drink frequently from the bottle of water to ensure you don't get dehydrated in the steam room.\n",
            "Stay in the steam room for 5 to 20 minutes.\n",
            "If after 5 minutes you've had enough and you want to leave the steam room, then do so. However, don't stay in the steam room for longer than 20 minutes at a time as you'll put your body at risk of overheating.[7]If you start to feel dizzy, nauseous, or uncomfortable at any time in the steam room, leave right away and find a cool place.\n",
            "Cool down slowly with water and air.\n",
            "You might have the urge to find the coldest place you possibly can after leaving the steam room but you should resist that urge. You could put your body in shock or start shivering. Instead, find a cool place and let your body naturally cool down.[8]Drink more water to restore the moisture you lost in the steam bath.\n",
            "Take another shower.\n",
            "Again, you might want to have the coldest shower you can after leaving the steam room but you'll only risk putting your body in a state of shock from sudden temperature changes. The shower should restore your body to its natural temperature.[9]Start out with a warm shower and slowly reduce the temperature until it's nice and cold.Some people will take a cool shower halfway through their steam bath so that the constant changes between hot and cold temperature increases the beneficial effects of their bath. This is only recommended for people who have been taking steam baths for a long time as they know what their bodies can deal with.\n",
            "Relax for a few minutes.\n",
            "It's important that you take some time and chill out after the steam bath. Most people feel that once the bath is over relaxation time is over and it's time to get back to the hustle and bustle of the world. This ruins their relaxation time.Take a few minutes and allow yourself to chill out and relax. You have already ensured that you have time to fully relax and you might as well enjoy this time.\n",
            "How to Deal with Vaginal Dryness: 11 Steps (with Pictures)\n",
            "Try lubricants.\n",
            "If your vaginal dryness is a problem during intercourse, using lubricants can help temporarily alleviate the problem.[2]Lubricants can be purchased online, in pharmacies, and can also be bought at sex shops. Lubricated condoms can also be purchased to alleviate vaginal dryness during intercourse.Lubricants should be applied directly to the vagina shortly before intercourse. Lubricants only temporary relief, so if you're looking for a long term cure you might want to look elsewhere.\n",
            "Try a vaginal moisturizer.\n",
            "Vaginal moisturizers are topical creams applied directly to the vagina. Most non-hormonal vaginal creams can be purchased over the counter.[3]Vaginal creams can be found at the supermarket or drug stores. Replens, Luvena, K-Y Silk-E Vaginal Moisturizer and KY Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer are examples of over the counter vaginal creams.Talk to your gynecologist before using any new products. While most are safe for use, some may increase the risk of infection and adverse reactions, such as rashes or sores.\n",
            "Use estrogen creams.\n",
            "Estrogen creams are topical ointments applied directly to the vagina that contain a low dose of the hormone estrogen. You must have a prescription to obtain estrogen cream.[4]Usually around bedtime, estrogen cream is inserted directly into the vagina with an applicator or a clean finger. Depending on your medical history, your doctor will tell you how often to use estrogen cream and in what amount.\n",
            "Make an appointment with your gynecologist.\n",
            "Vaginal dryness has a number of causes. If your vaginal dryness came on suddenly, you should see your gynecologist to rule out medical causes.[5]Usually, the cause of vaginal dryness is benign. Menopause, childbirth, and breastfeeding can all alter hormonal levels and cause dryness. However, occasionally vaginal dryness is caused by more serious problems like certain cancers and immune disorders. This is why it's important to see a doctor quickly if you notice any changes as for these types of diseases early intervention is important.Sjogren's Syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which your body's immune system attacks healthy tissues. In can lead to vaginal dryness, in addition to other symptoms like dry eyes and a dry mouth. Your doctor can perform a blood test to see if you have Sjogren's Syndrome.\n",
            "Ask about Hormone Replacement Therapy.\n",
            "If you're entering menopause, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) can ease many symptoms including vaginal dryness.[6]Not only can hormone replacement therapy improve vaginal dryness, it can help with other symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes. Usually, you would wear a patch or take oral tablets of low doses of estrogen and other hormones that your body produces less of as you enter menopause.Hormone replace therapy does carry some risks. Oral combined hormone pills that contain estrogen and progesterone have shown to increase the risk of breast cancer,  heart attack, and stroke. Talk to your doctor about these risk factors and how they might apply to you.\n",
            "Try an estrogen ring.\n",
            "An estrogen ring is a form of hormone replacement therapy that many women find easier to use than pills.[7]Your gynecologist inserts a small, flexible ring into the upper part of your vagina. The ring will release doses of estrogen on a regular schedule. It will need to be replaced every three months.\n",
            "Consider your existing medications.\n",
            "Oftentimes, vaginal dryness is a side effect of existing medication. Decongestants especially, found in many cold or allergy medications, can lead to vaginal dryness. If you believe your dryness is caused by your medications, talk to your doctor about alternative meds.[8]\n",
            "Use drug-free treatments.\n",
            "If you're interested in less drug-heavy treatment options, there are a variety of homeopathic options that are successful for some women.[9]Soybeans contain a substance called isoflavones that has an effect on the body that's similar to estrogen. A soybean rich diet might help reduce vaginal dryness.Black cohosh is an herb many women use as a dietary supplement and it may help with vaginal dryness. However, every major study has not found any benefit with use. Some women experience side effects like joint pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. You should not use black cohosh if you have liver damage or a hormone-sensitive condition like certain cancers or fibroid tumors. You should also not take black cohosh if you're pregnant. Talk to your health care provider before you begin any herbal treatments to make sure the herbs are safe for you.Some women use creams containing wild yam as a supplement, but no evidence exists that such creams are helpful and they may be damaging to the vagina.\n",
            "Do not douche.\n",
            "Cleansing your vagina with a liquid preparation, store bought or homemade, disrupts the balance of chemicals in your vagina and can lead to dryness and possibly infections. Do not douche as the vagina has self-cleaning mechanisms and does not need additional washing.[10]\n",
            "Allow foreplay during sex.\n",
            "Foreplay is any activity, like massaging, cuddling, kissing, oral sex, and other forms of erotic play, that occurs prior to sexual intercourse. Increasing the amount of time you and your partner engage in foreplay can increase arousal and therefore limit vaginal dryness. Talk to your partner about any issues you've been having with vaginal dryness and ask him or her to allow for more foreplay during intercourse. This may help lessen the problem.[11]In general, having an active sex life in general can help you stay lubricated and avoid vaginal dryness. Talk to your partner about the importance of regular sexual activity as it applies to both the physical and emotional aspects of your relationship.\n",
            "Try masturbation.\n",
            "Regular masturbation, especially for older women, can have a variety of health benefits including reducing vaginal dryness.[12]Female masturbation comes in a variety of forms and techniques, but the stimulation of the clitoris, urethra, and vagina can result in increased lubrication. If you're experiencing hormonal or other changes that lead to vaginal dryness, regular masturbation can help.\n",

            "3 Ways to Care for a Crowntail Betta Fish - wikiHow\n",
            "Get a tank thats at least 10 gallons (38L).\n",
            "Crowntail bettas need plenty of space so that they dont damage their large, delicate fins by crashing into the aquarium walls, so plan on having at least 10 gallons (38L) per betta.[2]If you plan to house your betta with other fish, you will need a bigger tank, though the exact size of your tank may depend on how much space the other fish needs. For example, if you add a blue gourami, the tank should be at least 20 gallons (76L). This is the minimum tank size for a blue gourami, and should provide enough room for both the gourami and the betta (which has smaller size requirements).[3]Dont try to keep your betta in a tiny fishbowl or vase. These environments are not spacious enough for your betta, and they will become dirty and polluted very quickly.\n",
            "Choose a tank with a fitted lid so your betta doesnt accidentally jump out.\n",
            "However, make sure to leave at least 12 inches (2.55.1cm) between the top of the water and the lid, since bettas like to come to the surface to gulp air.[4]Bettas are smart fishyou can train them to use their natural jumping behavior to perform tricks, like jumping through hoops!\n",
            "Add a biological filter with low airflow to aerate your betta's tank.\n",
            "The addition of a biological filter will encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria, which help to maintain a healthy balance of ammonia and nitrates in the tank. However, make sure to keep the air flow gentle, since a strong current can potentially damage your crowntail betta's delicate fins.[5]Get advice from a fish specialist at your pet store about what kind of filter will work best with your bettas tank.\n",
            "Keep the water temperature between 7680F (2427C).\n",
            "Use a submersible tank heater to keep your bettas water consistently warm. These tropical fish thrive in warm water, and temperature fluctuations can be dangerous for them.[6]Check the wattage on your heater to make sure it is appropriate for the size of your tank. For example, a 50-watt heater is ideal for 510 gallons (1938L) tanks. For a larger tank, you would need a higher wattage (e.g., 100 watts for a 20 gallons (76L) tank).Keep a thermometer in the tank so you can check that the heater is working correctly.\n",
            "Maintain a water pH of 6.4-7.0 and a hardness of 2-5.\n",
            "Water conditions such as pH level and carbonate hardness can affect your bettas health.[7] Pick up an aquarium test kit at your local pet store or bring in a sample of your aquariums water for testing.If your waters pH and hardness are not within a healthy range, ask a fish specialist at your pet store for advice on how to make adjustments.You can lower the pH of the water by adding organic materials such as driftwood or peat moss. If you need to raise the pH, you can do so by adding a small amount of baking soda to the water (typically 1 tsp (about 4.8 grams) per 5 gallons (19L) of water).You will also need to use water that is dechlorinated and free of other chemical contaminants.\n",
            "Place the tank in a dimly lit area.\n",
            "Bettas in the wild live in dark, plant-filled water.[8] Too much light is not good for the fish and will also encourage the growth of algae in the tank. Keep the tank out of direct sunlight and choose dim, artificial light sources.[9]If you add an artificial light to the tank, put it on a timer so that it stays on for 12 hours during the day and switches off for 12 hours overnight.\n",
            "Put plants and hiding places in the tank to promote your betta's happiness.\n",
            "Feel free to be creative with your decorations, but aim for plant-dense water that simulates a crowntail betta's natural habitat. Add an assortment of live or artificial plants, smooth-sided aquarium rocks, and fish caves to create the perfect underwater habitat.[10]Make sure any plants or decorations you add are aquarium-safe.[11] They should also be free of points and sharp edges, since these can damage your bettas fins.If you wish, you can also add a fine sand or gravel substrate to the bottom of the tank to give the environment a more natural look.\n",
            "Do a 10% water change every 2-3 days to keep your betta healthy.\n",
            "To replace the water in your aquarium, use a siphon to remove about 10% of the water from your bettas tank, then replace the water you removed with clean, dechlorinated water. Try to use water that is roughly the same temperature and pH level as the water in the tank. Repeat every few days to keep the water clean![12]If your tank has a sand or gravel substrate, you will need to use a siphon-powered vacuum to clean the substrate once every 1-2 weeks.You can do water changes a little less frequently (e.g., once a week) if your tank is larger than 10 gallons (38L). However, keep in mind that a tank with more fish in it will accumulate waste more quickly, so you may need to do more frequent changes if your betta has tank mates.A crowntail betta living in dirty water may be more prone to fin rot and other diseases.\n",
            "Feed your crowntail 2-3 small meals daily.\n",
            "Crowntail bettas have small stomachs, so they need to eat multiple small meals rather than have just one big feeding. You can feed your betta up to 3 times a day, but 2 feedings (in the morning and evening) are usually enough.[13]A good feeding schedule that you can try for a betta is 3 pellets in the morning, 3 pellets at night. [14]There are a variety of high-quality betta foods on the market, like Omega One Betta Buffet Pellets, New Life Spectrum Betta Pellets, and Hikari Betta Bio-Gold. You want to stay away from low quality foods like fish food made by Tetra and Aqueon. [15]\n",
            "Give your betta a variety of animal-based foods as snacks.\n",
            "Bettas are insectivorous fish that enjoy live and frozen foods. Good frozen options include bloodworms, black worms, mosquito larvae, brine shrimp, daphnia.You can also offer live foods such as white worms or wingless fruit flies. Freeze-dried foods should be fed only as a treat and not very often. [16]Try not to offer your betta too much of any of these treats during a feeding. For example, you might give it 2 or 3 freeze-dried bloodworms in one feeding.\n",
            "House male bettas without other males in the tank.\n",
            "Male bettas are highly aggressive and competitive fish. If you put more than one crowntail male in the same tank, they will fight and feel stressed all the time. They may even fight each other to the death.[17]Even keeping 2 male bettas within sight of each other in separate tanks can cause stress. A male betta will become aggressive and go into display mode at the sight of another male, any similar brightly colored fish, or even his own reflection.\n",
            "Keep males and females together only for breeding.\n",
            "Male bettas are less aggressive with females than they are with other males. However, aggression is still enough of a problem that these fish do not coexist well together. Keep your males and females separate unless you plan to breed them.[18]Successfully breeding crowntail bettas is a complicated and expensive process, so dont attempt it until you have a thorough understanding of whats involved.\n",
            "Create a sorority tank if you want to keep several females.\n",
            "Female crowntail bettas are also aggressive, but they can coexist in a group with other females if they have enough space and places to hide. To minimize aggression, make sure the tank has plenty of plants and hiding spots like rocks with holes in them or hollow betta logs. Offer at least one hiding place for each fish in your sorority, so that they can stake out individual territories. Sororities should only be kept by experienced betta fish keepers. [19]Sororities work best with groups of at least 5 females. If you have a group of 5, keep them in a tank that is at least 20 gallons or bigger.[20]While female crowntail bettas are less spectacular in appearance than the males, they are still strikingly beautiful fish.\n",
            "Choose non-competitive tankmates if you want to house your crowntails with other species.\n",
            "Bettas can coexist relatively peacefully with some fish of other species. To find a good companion for your crowntail, look for a non-aggressive species that occupies a different niche within the aquarium environment from the betta. For example, you might choose a bottom-feeding fish, since bettas spend most of their time in the higher levels of the tank.[21]Some good companions for bettas include neon tetras, feeder guppies, ghost shrimp, cherry shrimp, and nerite snails. Cory catfish are also a good bet, and they have the added benefit of helping to keep the tank clean.[22]Keep in mind that male bettas will still feel threatened by any fish that is similar in size, behavior, and coloration to a male betta.Research the space and feeding requirements of any potential tankmates before introducing them, as their needs might be different from your bettas.\n",
            "Watch your betta closely around other fish for signs of aggression.\n",
            "Even ideal tankmates are not necessarily immune to aggression from your crowntail betta. Whenever you introduce a new fish into a tank with your betta (or vice versa), watch carefully to make sure your fish are not fighting. Be prepared to separate the betta from the other fish if necessary.[23]When you first introduce your betta to a tank with other fish, keep the betta confined to a betta cup or other transparent enclosure for 30 minutes before releasing the it. Dont release the betta into the tank if you see it doing a threat display (e.g., expanding its gills and dancing back and forth).\n",

            "Combine the sugar and eggs in a bowl until a pale-yellow paste forms.\n",
            "Then, mix in the vanilla and salt. Smaller servings of microwave brownies can be made directly in a mug, but because you are working with such a large amount, you'll need to mix it in a separate bowl first.If you are vegan, mix 2 tablespoons (14 grams) of flaxseed meal with 5 tablespoons (74 milliliters) of water in a small dish. Wait 5 minutes for it to thicken, then add to the recipe.[3]If you are using the vegan option, consider adding  to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 grams) of baking soda as well. This will help make the brownies more tender.[4]\n",
            "Melt  cup (115 grams) of butter before adding it to the bowl.\n",

            "Mix the flour and cocoa powder in a separate bowl.\n",
            "Use a fork to break up any lumps, clumps, or chunks. Mixing these two ingredients separately will help them mix into the rest a little more evenly.\n",
            "Sift the flour mixture into the sugar, butter, and egg mixture, and fold the batter until evenly mixed.\n",
            "Sifting will help the batter to not have lumps and will result in a smoother batter with no grainy texture. There should be no lumps, clumps, or chunks when you are done. Be careful not to over-mix, however, or your brownies will end up too tough and chewy.Consider adding 1 cup (125 grams) of chopped walnuts for a crunchy texture.[6] If you don't like walnuts, you can try another type of nuts, such as pecans or pistachios.\n",
            "Pour the batter into a lightly greased glass baking dish.\n",
            "The ideal size to work with is 8 by 8 by 2 inches (20.32 by 20.32 by 5.08 centimeters). For extra texture, scatter  cup (90 grams) of chocolate chips or chunks on top of the batter after you have poured it.[7]\n",
            "Microwave the brownies, uncovered, on high until cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes.\n",
            "After every minute, you will want to pause the microwave and rotate the baking dish. Keep cooking until there is a 1 inch (3.18 centimeters) wide moist spot in the center.Cooking times will vary depending on the strength of your microwave.

            "10 Narcissist Cheating Patterns to Watch for in Your Relationship\n",
            "They lie to you about everything, big and small.\n",
            "You find them giving suspicious answers that you later find out arent true. Theyll lie repeatedly about their whereabouts after work yesterday, about their childhood, or about their romantic history. Narcissists are prone to tricking people about trivial things because they use it to prove to themselves that they're smarter than other people. As a result, they might end up going overboard on their lies when they're trying to hide their cheating.[1]These lies often turn into gaslighting, which is when they try to make you question your own sanity in order to get you to believe a lie. This could happen when you try to bring up warning signs of infidelitythey might try to make you believe youre crazy in order to get you to back down.[2]Lying is generally a trait of narcissism, but its a sign of cheating if you find them consistently lying about a friend of theirs or about where theyve been recently.\n",
            "They keep their distance from you.\n",
            "They dont commit too much to you in order to provide plausible deniability if they get caught cheating. They might reject labels, refuse to make promises of exclusivity, or suddenly back away from your relationship and ask for more space.[3]This could also be a sign of an avoidant attachment style, but if they also repeatedly lie, disregard your feelings, and imply theyre better than everyone else, its a part of narcissist cheating patterns.[4]\n",
            "They accuse you of cheating.\n",
            "Narcissists get defensive when theyre accused of something and end up projecting their own wrongdoing on someone else. If you tell them youre worried theyre being disloyal, they may flip it back on you and tell you that youre the one acting disloyal.[5]This tactic is really frustrating, but its important to remember that you know what youve observed and that youre not in the wrong.\n",
            "Theyre engaged in suspicious online behavior.\n",
            "They might always be on their phone texting someone, but then they lie and say theyre just scrolling through Instagram when you confront them. You might also spot them showering love and compliments on others on social media if theyre preparing to have an affair with someone else.[6]Check their social media accounts and the social media accounts of the people they might be interested in if you want to see if theyre devoting their attention to another romantic prospect.Watch out for them smiling or blushing at their phone a lot, giving nervous looks to you while theyre texting, or quickly hiding their screen when you come by. They might get a thrill out of texting their other lover while youre around since it reinforces their satisfaction at getting away with it.Reader Poll: We asked 240 wikiHow readers and 67% of them said that theyll suspect a person of being unfaithful if theyre frequently checking their phone or being secretive about communication. [Take Poll]\n",
            "They retaliate against you when you dont do what they want.\n",
            "If you start to suspect theyre cheating and ask to see their texts, they might respond with even more controlling measures for you, like giving them all your passwords and asking them before texting other people. They could also try to get revenge on you by starting rumors about you being unfaithful when its really them whos cheating.[7]Their retaliation can be really scary, but the most important thing is to disengage and not react. Theyre looking for a big reaction to validate their importance, so resist their manipulation without responding with vengeance of your own.\n",
            "They give bad excuses rather than owning up to their mistakes.\n",
            "When you confront them with evidence that they did something wrong, they never apologize. Instead, they claim that its your fault, that theyre the victim of crazy haters or an elaborate conspiracy, or they try to delay the conversation.[8]If you bring up something that someone said that contradicts a lie of theirs, theyll insult the reputation of the person who told you that, saying theyre crazy or mean.\n",
            "They make you doubt your own self-worth.\n",
            "When you question their loyalty, they lash out at you by insulting you, making you think that you dont deserve love, or telling you that you could never date someone better than them.[9]They can also make you feel insecure by ignoring you for long periods of time, making you lonely and reliant on their inconsistent attention.They make you feel inferior because they need to feel superior. Its nothing about you; its about their insecure and inflated sense of self.\n",
            "They're hot and cold.\n",
            "One day, they're almost too affectionate and loving, and the next, it's back to a cold relationship. This is called love-bombing. They shower you with extravagant gifts and attentionso much it might make you feel uncomfortableto manipulate you into staying with them. They also do this to reward you for believing their excuses and staying with them. Before long, though, their love will fade and theyll go back to insulting you and questioning your sanity.[10]They might do this to make you feel guilty about your suspicions and doubt your judgments of them as disloyal, but intense love-bombing is really just another form of manipulation. Its not a sign of loyalty, love, or a healthy relationship.[11]\n",
            "They suddenly change their intimacy patterns.\n",
            "They might seem disinterested in sex since they have a new sexual relationship, or they might start trying a bunch of new things in bed to try and distract you from their infidelity. Whatever the shift is, the key is looking for a sudden change in their sexual behavior that happens with no explanation. They could be using sex to control you one way or another.[12]\n",
            "They start fights for no reason.\n",
            "In order to cheat, they need time away from you, so they blow up out of nowhere to make you both upset. Then, once you both say you need some time apart to cool off, that gives them a window to pursue their affair for a day or two.[13]Little disagreements can also be a false justification for larger problems in the relationship like their infidelity. By nit-picking and arguing about tiny things, they manufacture their unhappiness in order to feel like they're justifying their infidelity.[14]\n",
            "Gather facts about their behavior.\n",
            "Narcissists will always try to weasel out of an accusation, so prepare concrete facts to show them that you know what theyre doing and you wont be gaslit. With evidence, your worries will be much harder for them to dismiss.  You can take screenshots of their social media or texts to you, read back through your journals to remember how they acted on a specific day, and talk to other people that know them in order to gather facts.Be aware that they might react like youre being nosy or controlling by gathering information. Dont do anything too invasive, like hacking a social media account, taking pictures of them without their permission or following them without them knowing.\n",
            "Process your emotions.\n",
            "You probably have complicated emotions about your narcissistic partner, so take the time to notice your feelings and the impact that your partner has on you. Understand where both you and your partner are coming from. Understanding yourself will help you make a decision and explain your feelings clearly to your partner when the time comes.[15]Write a pro-con list for the relationship or create a bullet list of all the different ways that they make you feel. Note how often you experience the good or bad parts of your relationship. Which is more frequent? This might help you decide whether to stay or leave the relationship.Recognize if youre in a toxic relationship. If they consistently care more about themselves than you, try to control you, and frequently devalue you, youre better off without them.\n",
            "Make a decision about your relationship.\n",
            "Decide once and for all to leave them if the relationship feels narcissistic, deceptive, and controlling. If they show real improvement for a sustained period of time, you can consider staying with them, but keep in mind that a narcissist might be manipulating you.[16]If you decide to stay, set firm rules and boundaries for their behavior to prevent them from hurting you again.[17]\n",
            "Confront your partner about their behavior.\n",
            "Write down what you want to tell your narcissistic partner and then confront them, telling them what you are going to do gently but firmly. Dont deviate from your plan, even if they protest or seem to say all the right things. Stay relaxed and non-reactive, even if they blow up and make a big scene. Dont validate them with the big reaction they want.[18]Once they realize you might leave them, they will try to tempt you to stay, but their promises are likely hollow.If they have been abusive in the past, be careful as you navigate leaving the relationship. Get help from someone you trust or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline to get assistance in leaving the relationship.\n",
            "Go to therapy if you're having a hard time processing the relationship.\n",
            "Narcissists can cause you real trauma and make it hard for you to love yourself and others again after the relationship. A therapist will help you recover from their deception and abuse by rebuilding the way you see yourself and helping you recognize the ways you were mistreated. Even if you don't feel deeply traumatized, a therapist could help you understand how to build a healthier relationship.[19]\n",
            "They feel theyre more important than anyone else.\n",
            "Narcissists think that they're better than everyone else and that the normal rules of relationships don't apply to them. They feel entitled to more love and partners than other people. They also feel like they get a pass to disregard promises they've made their partner.[20]\n",
            "Narcissists enjoy manipulating people into loving them.\n",
            "Other people are just pawns in their chess game, and they like twisting the game to their advantage. A narcissists manipulations make them feel powerful and special, and cheating is one way to manipulate the people around them.[21]\n",
            "They often lack the empathy to feel bad when they hurt others.\n",
            "Narcissists have a hard time considering the negative effects of their actions on others and treating others emotions as important. They only think about what they get out of a situation, and cheating gets them more than what they had before. Other peoples feelings dont get consideration, so they cheat.[22]\n",
            "They crave attention.\n",
            "Narcissists need a lot of love and praise to maintain their delusions of self-importance. As a result, they might need to cheat to feed their ego and get more attention than one person alone can give them. It's not your fault, though: some narcissists always crave more and more attention.[23]Even the heartbreaking fallout from an affair can validate them by giving them more attention and a sense of power. Sometimes, negative attention still feeds a narcissists sense of self-importance.\n",
            "They lack self-control.\n",
            "Narcissists often make impulsive decisions based on their split-second urges, which is a recipe for disaster when it comes to a committed relationship. If one day they want to have sex outside of their relationship, they might do it without a second thought.[24]\n",

            "Get rid of the stuff you don't need.\n",
            "First, you have to assess your stuff to have a sense of what you're taking with you on the move and what you're leaving behind. There could be a variety of reasons for leaving your stuff behind. Your new place could be smaller, you could be moving in with someone with nicer versions of your stuff, or you could just be ready to get rid of the old junk you don't need.  Here's how you do it:Assess the space in your new place. Get the dimensions of every room in your new home and then measure your furniture to have a better sense of what fits and what doesn't.Sell your stuff on Craigslist. You should start doing this at least a few weeks in advance to make sure that people have enough time to pick up your stuff. If you have great photos and some useful stuff, it'll be pretty easy to sell your things, and you may be surprised by just how quickly people buy up your things. For this reason, you shouldn't post your stuff on Craigslist too far in advance, or you might just end up without a dining room table for a month.Understand the challenge of selling your mattresses. You may have a mattress and box spring in amazing condition that you want to sell, but know that people are wary of buying a bed from a perfect stranger. Either prepare to set your price real cheap, or advertise with your friends, family, and people who actually know you.Have a yard sale. This is a great way to get rid of a lot of your stuff in one fell swoop. Do your best to advertise your moving sale if you feel like foot traffic in your area isn't that steady.Donate your stuff. You may not like your old clothes or shoes, but a lot of people would benefit from them.Have a moving party and put all the stuff you don't want in the corner of your room. You'll be surprised by how quickly your guests snatch them up.Sell your old books to a used book store, or donate them to a library.In the weeks leading up to your move, eat as much of the food in your fridge, freezer, and pantry as you can, so you can avoid heavy cans, or melting or messy food items.\n",
            "Pack for the move\n",
            ". Though packing your stuff will take a long time, as long as you're organized and have a good plan in advance, it shouldn't consume your life. You should start packing at least a few weeks in advance so you have enough time to pack everything, but not so far in advance that you're surrounded by clutter and start packing away the things you'll need. Here's what to do:[1]Get your cardboard boxes ready. You will need more cardboard boxes than you think. You can get them for free from your local grocery store, find them under \"free stuff\" on craigslist, get them from a friend who recently moved, or just buy them if you want to save time.[2]Label all of your boxes carefully.[3] You should write where each box should go on the tops and on the sides of the boxes, so you'll know where the boxes should go even if they're stacked on top of each other.Pack a box of essential items. You should do this on the morning or night before your move. The box should include bathroom necessities such as toothpaste, shampoo, soap, your shower rods and curtain, and towels, as well as any overnight essentials like your bedspread, blanket, pillows, and pajamas. Also, if you can't live without caffeine, pack away your coffee maker or tea and tea kettle.Pack all the items that go in the same room in one box. Don't worry about separating your books from your notebooks, if they'll both go in your office. Just put everything that goes in the same part of your room in one box so you can unpack the stuff more easily.Have a \"packing station\" in your house. Instead of cluttering each of your rooms with a few boxes, pick one place to keep all your packed items.Keep your hardware in a prominent place. Make sure your toolbox is on-hand when you move so you start assembling your furniture again. You can either put it in your essentials box, or keep it in the cabin of your moving truck or your car.Hang on to your essential paperwork. Hold on to any paperwork that is related to your old home, your new home, or your moving process. Don't pack it away with the other stuff that goes in your desk, or you won't be able to find it in a pinch.\n",
            "Ask some trusted friends for help in advance.\n",
            "Whether your friends are heroically helping you move all of your boxes, or if they're just hanging out for moral support, you should let them know when you're moving well advance. Send them an email or give them a call asking for their help on the big moving day.Don't forget to reward your friends for helping you. Though they're offering to help you out of the kindness of their hearts, you should still make sure to take them out to a restaurant after the move, or to order in beer and pizza.\n",
            "Set up the utilities in your new home and coordinate services and places ahead of your move.\n",
            "Call ahead to make sure you have heat and electricity in your new home, or your move will be off to a very unpleasant start.[4]Utilities include water / gas / electric (often bundled), telephone / TV / internet (also often bundled), home security, and refuse.Services that you'll need to coordinate once you move in include address change through the USPS website as well as anything tied to your address, for example, insurance, banking, or car licenses and registration.Places to locate include the nearest hospital, fire station, police station, village hall, country government, post office, park district, animal hospital, library, public transportation, and school.\n",
            "Hire a removals van.\n",
            "If you're tackling the move by yourself, then you'll need to arrange to pick up a removals van on the morning of the move. Make this arrangement well in advance, or it may be tricky to hire a van exactly when you want it for a reasonable price during a busy moving season.[5]Compare the prices of a few companies before making your decision.\n",
            "Pick up your vehicle on the morning of the move.\n",
            "Get there early to avoid waiting in a queue on a busy moving day.\n",
            "Pack your moving truck.\n",
            "Packing your moving truck won't be a big challenge if you plan in advance and have the help of a few trusted friends when you do it. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you pack your moving truck:[6]Remember that you will need at least two people to handle things other than lifting and hauling. They will need to organize the things that need to be loaded by keeping the packed boxes close to the door easily accessible.Disassemble your furniture. Take apart any lamps, tables with removable legs, bookshelves, and entertainment systems.Protect your furniture. Wrap all of your items with packing paper, bubblewrap and tape as you load them into the truck.Load the heaviest items first, into the back of the truck. This includes your fridge, washer, dryer, and other appliances, as well as your heaviest boxes.Load the heaviest boxes. Stack them like bricks to form layers of walls that fill the back of the truck. Use T-stacks to make the boxes more stable: make each vertical seam make a T with the horizontal layer below it, like bricks in a house. Avoid vertical pillars of similar sized boxes. To maximize space, it is essential to stack high, stable walls early on.Next, load your longer items into the truck. This includes your bed and shelves. Lean them against the sides of the truck.Pack your remaining boxes into the truck. Create three layers of boxes which includes the heaviest boxes on the bottom, the medium-sized boxes in the middle, and the lightest boxes on top. Once you're done with each layer, tape it together with packing tape.Put in your remaining items. The trick is to make everything fit snugly together, but don't pack it so tight that it looks ready to explode.When using the ramp of a box van, such as the vans pictured, make sure the ramp has been fitted into place: once you have fully extended the ramp from under the truck, you will find two prongs that will fit into slots on the lip of the van's cargo space. This will ensure that the ramp is flush with the lip, and make it a breeze to use the dolly. This step is often overlooked.Make sure the dolly is one of the last things to get loaded, so you will have it as soon as you arrive at the new house.\n",
            "Drive your truck to your new location.\n",
            "Carefully drive the truck to your new home. Be prepared to drive slower and more carefully than you would do in a car. Driving a moving truck takes a big adjustment.[7]Remember to go slowly and stay calm, because the drive may be stressful.\n",
            "Unload your stuff.\n",
            "If at all possible, back the truck up to the new house so that the ramp will extend onto the porch. Use all of your crew as spotters to make sure you are clear of any obstacles. When you are close to the porch, extend the ramp and hook it in place, and have a crew member carry the opposite end. Most ramps will not latch properly unless the end is on the ground. Once you have the ramp set up, here's how you can unload your stuff:Have a plan for where you're going to put the large items in each room.  Do a walk through with the movers, and show them where the larger items go, such as the sofas, TV, cabinets, beds, dressers, night-stands, etc.Choose where to put the boxes and small items in each room based on that.[8]  That way the boxes won't be in the way when the big furniture comes in.  And you won't have to move the boxes again.  You can put Post-it notes on the wall if necessary.\n",
            "Return your moving truck.\n",
            "You will have arranged whether you will do this the same day or the next morning.\n",
            "Research to find the best company.\n",
            "If you want to move with the help of a moving company, you will have to spend a lot more money for your move, but you will save yourself from the stress of having to move your boxes, drive a moving truck, and unload your boxes. Look for a company that has insurance and workers' compensation just in case there's an accident.[9] Finding the right moving company is a big commitment so you need to do your research carefully before you make a decision.[10]Avoid the Internet at first. This is the easiest way to get caught in a moving scam. Instead, check out the listings in your phone book, call a local real estate agent, or ask friends for their recommendations.Pick a place that will do an in-home estimate. If they won't, hang up the phone.Make sure the company will be doing it themselves, and not sub-contracting to have someone else do it.Make sure the company can give you a \"Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move\" booklet.Get as much information about the company as you can. Try to pick a company that has been in business for at least ten years. Ask about the included services, and for a list of references.\n",
            "Once you've narrowed your search to two or three companies, go online to find out if they are legitimate.\n",
            "You'll need to have the company's DOT and MC license numbers to do this. Now you can make sure that the company is not only authorized to perform your move, but that they have insurance to do it.[11]First, check out SafeSys.org. Type those DOT and MC numbers into the site and see what comes up.Next, make sure the company checks out on the  'FMCSA Licensing & Insurance site' link on the bottom of the report you get about the company.Last, check out the Better Business Report to read up on the company.\n",
            "Have the company come to make an assessment.\n",
            "The company will send a representative to check out all of your stuff and to give you an estimate about how much it will cost to move it all. The company will give you an estimate based on what they see in your home.[12]Don't use a company that will only give you an estimate based on cubic feet.If you really want to find the best company, you can arrange to have two or three companies to come and make an assessment and pick the one with the best service and best prices. But this will be more time-consuming.\n",
            "Make a deal with the moving company.\n",
            "Decide on a rate that works for both of you, and sign a contract that is well-detailed and suits your needs. Never sign a blank contract. Through your arrangement, you will decide on the moving date.\n",
            "Move with the movers.\n",
            "Now that you've chosen your moving company and have decided on a date, it's time to prepare for the big move. Though you won't be doing any heavy lifting, you should still be around when the movers transport and unload your stuff. This will be an exception if you're arranging them to move your stuff into your new place when you won't be there.When the movers are unloading your stuff, stay out of their way. Don't offer to help unless they have questions.Reward your movers. Once they've done their hard work, or even while they're doing their hard work, order some lunch for them if you want to be nice. And make sure to give them a generous tip.[13]\n",
            "Unpack your stuff.\n",
            "Now that you've unloaded your stuff at your new home, it's likely that you're feeling overwhelmed. Have patience and don't force yourself to start unpacking everything right away. Just focus on getting it done little by little and you'll have your new place ready in no time. Here's what you can do:[14]Unpack your essential items first. Unpack the stuff from your \"essential stuff\" box. Put up your shower curtain in case you need a relaxing shower and make your bed if you just want to collapse.Try to unpack your kitchen items early on. Though you should relax and eat take-out when you first arrive at your new place, you can't do that forever. The sooner your kitchen is set up, the sooner you can start living a normal life.Assemble all of your big furniture. Make sure you assemble it in the room where it belongs.Do only as much as you can each day. Though you shouldn't wait months to unpack, you are probably overwhelmed after your move, so unpack as many boxes as you can until you need a break. Remember to take the time to enjoy your new surroundings.\n",
            "Go shopping.\n",
            "Once you've started the unpacking process, it'll be time to go shopping for any items you may need. Your shopping can include going to the grocery store to stock your fridge, buying any furniture you may need, or replacing items you can't find.Take it one step at a time. If you really need a lot of new items, make a day of it, but if you just need a few things, you don't have to do it all at once.\n",
            "Get to know your new neighborhood.\n",
            "Once you're far along in the unpacking process, or just feel like taking a break, it's time to get to know your neighborhood. This is a great way to feel more comfortable in your new surroundings and to feel like your stressful move will pay off in the end. Here's what to do:Go for a walk. Not only will this relieve stress and give you great exercise, but you will have a better sense of the feel of your neighborhood, what your neighbors are like, and what stores or parks are near you.Look online or in a local newspaper to check out cultural attractions, bars, or restaurants. See what your new hood has to offer.Tell your Facebook friends that you've moved to a new place. Ask if they have any recommendations of where to go or even where to shop. Even people you barely know will be happy to offer advice on this topic.Get to know your neighbors. Be friendly to the people in your neighborhood. You'll end up making more local friends and getting insider tips on your community in the process.\n",

            "Perfect your first touch, setting yourself up for your next pass, shot, or dribble without pausing.\n",
            "Your first touch is essential, and this skill is what separates the pros from the amateurs. You need to be able to stop a ball at your feet from the air or from the ground, laying it right in front of you so that your next touch can immediately start the attack. Make sure you learn to \"trap\" the ball with your whole body by:Close-range one-touch passing with a partner. If your very first touch is an accurate pass, defenders will have fits trying to steal the ball from you. You can also practice this by kicking against a wall.Having a teammate or friend throw or cross a ball in the air. You must take only 2 touches -- one to settle, the other to pass it back to them.Passing and shooting on the run. Have someone feed you a ball on the run, timing your first touch so that you can pass or shoot on the second touch without breaking stride.[1]\n",
            "Practice close-touch ball handling drills.\n",
            "Your goal with the following exercises isn't just to get faster, it is to get more precise, learning to control the ball with your entire foot to become a better dribbler and passer. Try out these drills, aiming for 100 touches on each foot with each drill: Bounce the ball between your feet, using the insoles to keep the ball between your knees and \"passing\" back and forth as quickly as possible.Tap the ball rapidly on the top with your toes, working on getting as quick as possible. As you improve. Work on actually rolling the ball slightly with the sole of your toe, focusing on this small, precise touch.Try the \"in-and-out.\" Use the sole of your right foot to roll the ball to the right. Roll your foot all the way over the ball to the right, then use your instep to pass the ball to the left foot. Control it with the sole of your left and roll it out, repeating the drill with both feet, back and forth.[2]\n",
            "Practice pulling off shots and crosses on the run.\n",
            "If you've been playing for a while, you generally know how to shoot and cross effectively when the ball isn't moving. But this isn't especially \"lifelike\" in a real game, and you'll be leaps and bounds above the competition once you're accurate and powerful on the move. Luckily, this is an easy skill to practice both alone and with a partner. Simply take a touch, get up to roughly 75% full speed, and then take the shot.As you get better, pick up the speed. Once you can hit a dead sprint, take a touch, and fire off a shot or cross, you'll be a defender's worst nightmare.Approach from a variety of angles, from hitting shots while running up the center of the field to working on crosses across your body from the sidelines.Work on your position's skills. A defender, for example, needs to be able to turn the ball and hit up the field as fast as possible to release pressure from an attack.\n",
            "Pay attention to your \"opposite\" or non-dominant foot.\n",
            "It doesn't matter how good your right foot is when you're up against top defenders, who will learn to quickly force you to your left. Great players are dangerous with both feet, forcing defenders to cover all the options. Don't eliminate half of your body from your arsenal -- make sure you work both feet.\n",
            "Learn to dribble with precise, tight control.\n",
            "The ball should feel like an extension of your foot. Take it into a small area (like the penalty box) and just dribble between the lines, varying your speed with sharp sprints and quick stops. Try out a few moves and use both feet, working until you tire out. Your goal is to get the ball as tight to your feet, at any speed, as possible. You'll make defenders lives much harder, and you can continue training by:Setting up obstacle courses with flags, cones, or old T-shirts. Make yourself zig-zag, weave, and change directions as fast as you can without losing the ball.Juggling may seem \"useless\" in a real game, but it is the easiest way to improve your touch on the ball, keeping it close with your entire body. Work on both feet, as well as the length of your touch, alternating tight, small juggles and higher, harder to handle touches.Work on some advanced moves and tricks, as they require precise ball control and give you new offensive tools in games.\n",
            "Learn to hit the ball in different areas to get different spins and shots.\n",
            "Where and how you hit a ball will greatly change how it travels, and the best players have the best ball control. Whether on offense or defense, learning how to use the whole ball greatly increases your options anywhere on the field.Short and accurate passes usually occur with the inside of your foot. Even precise, mid-level crosses can be hit this way.Hitting the ball on the outside thirds will cause it to bend if you use your laces. Work on getting under the ball a bit, as if hitting it from a diagonal angle.You can knuckle the ball by cracking it with laces just below dead center and avoiding a follow-throw, taking away the spin and causing the ball to dip unpredictably.Get under the ball, using the edge between your laces and instep, for a backspin chip, which is good for precise crosses that can't bounce or skip away.Always follow through with your foot when you hit the ball, whether it's a shot, a pass, or a cross. This will give you more control over where the ball goes.[3]\n",
            "Learn one-on-one defending to be useful anywhere on the field.\n",
            "From strikers to center-backs, everyone needs to know individual defending. So get a partner and start playing 1v1, working on handling your man and pressuring him effectively. When defending one on one, remember to:Stay slightly crouched and on the balls of your feet.  Your knees should be bent in an athletic position, allowing you to react quickly.Angle your body, with one foot ahead of the other, so that you invite the attacker to go to one side. Force them to the sideline, or to your other defenders, instead of standing straight up and letting them choose your direction.Watch a player's hips to avoid getting tricked. Your hips are your center of gravity, and they generally telegraph where a player is going unless they're Lionel Messi. It is almost impossible to quickly change your hips direction, and you can use this to your advantage as a defender.\n",
            "Keep your eyes up throughout the game, especially when you have the ball.\n",
            "Great players are always scanning the field, especially when they have the ball. This takes practice, as it's harder to control a ball you can't see. But learning to use the bottom of your eyesight while scanning the field is an essential skill to become a smarter, and thus better, player.Use practices to work on keeping your head up. Turn the ball over now, not in games, and you'll quickly see improvement.\n",
            "Communicate on the field, talking constantly to aid your team.\n",
            "Great players are always talking: \"Open man,\" \"I've got the ball,\" \"I need some help,\" and much, much more is constantly being shouted on the field, and there is a good reason. Soccer is a team game, and intelligent players know the team must be on the same page for all 90 minutes to get the most out of the game. Be a team leader and start chattering every game and practice. Essential things to talk about throughout the game include:Defensive Marks: let your team know who you're covering if you want to challenge the ball, and if there are any unmarked defenders who need to be covered.Advice to the player dribbling: don't shout tons of info at them, but don't leave them in the dark. Tell them when they have time and when there is a \"man on.\"Making Runs: Tell your teammate you're \"overlapping!\" or that \"you can play it back\" if they need. When you make a big run, don't assume they will always see you, especially if their head is down.[4]\n",
            "Watch professional games at least once a week, learning from the best.\n",
            "Note where the players are not just when they have the ball, but off of it. What runs are people in your position making? When do they move up to attack and when do they peel back. Don't be afraid to be a bit of a critic -- use these games to learn new ideas and break down why certain things didn't work. How would you play differently, and how would you like to emulate your favorite players?Burgeoning players can also check out tutorials, clips, and highlights on YouTube, which can help fill in gaps if you're unsure what techniques the pros are using on shots or passes.Find a team or league you love and become a fan -- the more you watch the better your play will be.\n",
            "Learn the basics of team tactics, becoming a team leader on offense and defense.\n",
            "A big part of soccer intelligence is learning how to work as a team. While each team has specific strategies that they must develop together, there are some tactics that hold true no matter what team you're on:Contract on defense, expand on offense. This is the basis of all strategies -- you want to take away space on defense and create space when attacking. So, on defense, you come together near the center of the field, forming a unified base and moving together to prevent offensive threats. On offense, you try to make them break this base by stretching out to defend you and your team.Follow up all shots, forcing the defense to react. Even decent shots can turn into goals if your team is crashing the goal on shots and crosses. This sort of pressure can upend defenses, as defenders will face their own goal on a rebound and have a very hard time clearing it safely.Keep your shape defensively. Even if you're not playing an offside trap, the defense should be on a horizontal line, holding shape. When defenses lose this shape, they create gaps and holes between themselves. If you play in the back, always look left and right and keep everyone in a mostly even line.\n",
            "Try out and play for the best teams you can find\n",
            ". There are no shortcuts to being a better soccer player other than playing as much as you can. That said, you'll get much better much faster if you're up against the toughest competition you can handle. Try out for a team that pushes you, or, if that's not possible, make challenges for yourself. Go join the local adult pick-up game (just bring cleats and jump on the field,) get your teammates to play with you in the offseason, and keep practicing alone when there is no one to join you.[5]If you have no players around to jump in with, go shoot against a wall, pass back and forth with a fence, or juggle and work on your tricks in the backyard.Play small games too, like 1 on 1 or 4 vs. 4. Small games give you more chances to practice with the ball and improve your skills.[6]\n",
            "Get fit for your position to get the most out of training.\n",
            "While all soccer players need to train to get the most out of their play, all players need to train differently. By thinking about your position's specific needs you can get the most out of your body and be the biggest asset to your team.Goalies: Focus on your strength, reaction time, and a slim, quick figure that can move in an instant.Defenders: Must be physically strong, both upper body and lower, to win any tackle or challenge. Need great sprinting speed as well, and should be fit.Midfielders: Must be able to run and run and run. Quick decision making, and the touch and passing ability to back it up, are essential.Forwards: Should be fast and able to jostle with strong defenders. They also tend to be endurance runners, able to jog around all game to make space and still win a sprint to the end line.\n",
            "Keep moving off the ball, not just when you may receive it.\n",
            "Great soccer players rarely stand still. As defenders, you are constantly shutting down space and reacting to the offense. As a midfielder, you're constantly scanning the field and moving to the ball, opening up space in the middle. As a striker, you're constantly trying to outfox a defender, slipping by them or disappearing when they are ball watching. You must always be moving, keeping the field open and dynamic and the other team guessing -- standing still makes you almost useless to your team.Check to the ball, even if you don't get it. As soon as you appear, demand the ball, but leave immediately if you don't get it. You'll have a defender following you, which opens up the space you were just in for your team.Spread wide when your team gets the ball if you play near a wing -- a quick counterattack to the sidelines often has the most space to push forward.If you don't have a man to mark, fill in the space an attacker might want. Try to figure out the most dangerous passing lanes to goal and sit in them, clogging them for the other team.[7]\n",
            "Take every practice seriously, working on your weak spots.\n",
            "Practice is the time to get over your weaknesses, not impress your teammates. Treat each practice like a warm-up for a huge game, working yourself hard in every drill and testing out new moves now so that they become second-nature in a game.Play multiple positions -- improve as both a shooter and a defenderFocus on both feet -- no one cares if you turn it over now, but they do care in games.Play quickly in practice especially. Don't slow down or take it lightly, even if your defenders are putting less than game pressure on you.\n",
            "Play and make decisions as quickly as possible.\n",
            "Scouts and coaches look a lot at your pace of play -- how fast you receive the ball, look up, and pass/shoot/dribble. Don't hold onto the ball too long, and practice making quick, decisive decisions on the ball, pushing yourself to play with urgency. Good ways to do so include:Pass the ball and keep moving. A few quick touches are usually enough, as the ball moves much faster than you can run. The longer you're in the same area, the longer the defense has to shut down holes and get set.If you plan to dribble, do so at a good quick pace instead of slowly. Put the defenders on the back foot.Look for crosses, especially ones that force the defenders to face their own goal. Big passes force a defense to scramble into new positions quickly, which often opens up holes.[8]\n",
            "Search out advice, guidance, and coaching in your weak areas.\n",
            "No matter how much better at soccer you get, you'll never be a perfect player. Soccer requires 11 players in complete unison to succeed, so keep your ears open to your coaches and mentors. Each player has specific weaknesses they can work on -- don't close your ears to your own.Ask your coach what you can do to get better a few times a season. How can you work on your own skills outside of practice?Consider calling in a personal coach or trainer to work on the skills you don't have time for in practice. If you really want to excel, especially in an area without high-level teams, you'll need the individual attention.\n",

            "Work with a registered dietitian to set the best dietary plan for you.\n",
            "While everyone can benefit from eating a healthier diet, different people have different dietary needs and goals. Your dietitian can help you devise the ideal dietary plan for you, based on factors like your current weight and fitness level and any medical conditions you have.[1]If your goal is to lose weight, for instance, you might say, \"I want to shed some poundshow much should I aim for, and what's the best way for me to get there?\"Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian.\n",
            "Set clear dietary goals for yourself.\n",
            "Its a great start that youre determined to eat healthy, but you need to be more specific about what exactly you want to accomplish. After consulting with your doctor, write down a list of clear, achievable goals that you intend to meet.[2]You may want to start by writing down what youd like to change about your current diet. You might write things like: I need to eat more vegetables, or, I need to snack less.Then, write down the dietary goals you intend to achieve. For example: I will fill half my plate with vegetables at every meal, or, I will only snack on healthy foods that Ive prepared myself.\n",
            "Set your goals in stages if youre making a major overhaul.\n",
            "It will probably be very difficult for you to completely change your entire diet all of a sudden, and youll end up more likely to fall back into your old eating patterns. If you need to make major dietary changes, start by setting 2 or 3 goals, then set 2 or 3 more once youve achieved the first batch.[3]You might, for instance, set a goal to reduce the number of times you buy sodas or snacks from the vending machines at work, then move on to eliminating them completely.Or, you might start with a positive goal, like eating fresh fruit for breakfast every morning, then move on to eliminating bacon from your breakfast menu.\n",
            "Start a food diary to track your progress.\n",
            "Write down your current goals in the journal, then keep track of everything that you eat and drink at each meal. Recording your diet will give you tangible evidence of your progress, or tangible motivation to get back on track.[4]Before you even begin your new diet, consider keeping track of your current eating habits for a few days or even weeks. This gives you clear evidence of your starting point, and it can be useful to bring it to your dietitian when establishing your new diet.You can keep an old-fashioned food diary, or use one of many smartphone apps. You may find the apps more convenient, and they also usually offer detailed nutritional information for the foods youre eating.\n",
            "Make fruits and veggies the centerpieces of your diet.\n",
            "No matter your particular dietary needs or goals, fruits and vegetables should have starring roles in your plan. Generally speaking, the average adult should aim to eat 5-9 servings of fruits and veggies per day. Another way to look at this is to fill half of your plate at every meal with vegetables and fruits.[5]In terms of measurements, aim for about 2.5-3 cups (565-675 grams) of vegetables per dayyour needs may be slightly more or less based on your age, gender, and other factors.[6]Likewise, aim for about 1.5-2 cups (340-450 grams) of fruits per day.[7]\n",
            "Complement your fruits and veggies with lean proteins.\n",
            "Lean proteins include poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, and beans, among other options. Aim for about 3-5 servings per day, with 1 serving being about the size of a deck of cards.[8]Other proteins, like beef, are higher in calories and fat and should be eaten sparingly.\n",
            "Choose whole grain breads, cereals, rice, and pasta.\n",
            "Whole grain options include whole wheat, brown rice, quinoa, farro, and millet, among others. Aim for about 5-6 servings of whole grains per day if you're a woman or 6-7 servings per day if you're a man, with 1 slice of whole grain bread equivalent to a single serving.[9]Processed grains, like white bread, white rice, and traditional pasta, are stripped of many of their health benefitsbut not their calories!\n",
            "Include healthy fats in your diet.\n",
            "Fat isn't necessarily a bad word when you're trying to eat healthyyou just need to eat the right kinds of fat! You can get healthy fats from foods like avocados, olive oil, nuts, flax seeds, and fatty fish like salmon.[10]Because all fats, even healthy ones, are high in calories, keep  your daily intake fairly limited.\n",
            "Make unhealthy food choices 20% or less of your daily diet.\n",
            "Instead of trying to eliminate all unhealthy foods from your diet all at once, incrementally cut back and replace them with healthier options. Your end goal should be for at least 80% of your daily diet to be healthy foods, but its okay to indulge with that other 20%!Unhealthy foods to cut back on include: processed foods, packaged foods, and fast food; foods that are high in sugar, sodium, and/or saturated or trans fats; and alcohol, especially if you consume more than 1-2 drinks per day.[11]Using an 80/20 plan, you might figure that gives you about 4 \"cheat\" meals per week, or you might spread it out and have an unhealthy \"cheat\" snack each day, as long as the rest of your meals are healthy. If you're eating a \"cheat\" snack daily, you may want to cut back on the amount over time.\n",

Meal planning helps you to stay on track and organized as you develop your new dietary routines.[12]Look for online guides and apps that can provide advice and menu ideas for your healthy meal planning. Even better, work with a registered dietitian who can guide you through the process of creating meal plans each week.Meal planning can help you eat healthier, and it can also save you money and time. Youll know exactly what groceries you need to buy each week, and you can factor in leftovers nights to make full use of extra food from previous meals.\n",
            "Make a grocery list based on your meal plan, and stick to it.\n",
            "With your meal plan as your guide, you can draw up a shopping list that has everything you need and nothing you dont for the week ahead. So make sure you buy whats on the list and nothing more![13]Especially when youre new to meal planning, use recipes to guide the amounts of different foods you need to buy. Over time, youll be able to accurately estimate how much youll need each week.Focus on your list while you shop, and check off items as you pick them up. Fight the temptation to buy foods (especially unhealthy ones) that arent on the list!You may find it easier to stick to your list if you dont grocery shop when youre hungry.\n",
            "Look for healthy shortcuts to cut back on your meal prep time.\n",
            "For the most part, youll want to avoid processed and packaged foods when planning your meals and buying your groceries. However, there are some ways to cut back on your prep time without sacrificing nutritional value.Fresh-frozen fruits and vegetables have the same nutrients as fresh ones, as do, for the most part, canned fruits and veggies. However, watch for added sodium in canned vegetables and added sugar in canned fruits.[14]You can also buy pre-cut, washed, and bagged salads and veggies, diced melons and pineapples, and other similar options.Additionally, you might consider getting pre-grilled and frozen chicken breast strips that you only need to heat and serve. Such conveniences will increase your grocery bill, however.\n",
            "Assemble your meals in batches to streamline meal prep.\n",
            "Since youve planned your meals for the week ahead and have all the ingredients youll need, consider setting aside an afternoon to prep (and, in many cases, cook) all your meals for the week. Use your refrigerator and freezer to keep the meals ready to go until the appropriate mealtime.[15]Once you get the hand of batch cooking, you may want to start taking a whole day or weekend to prepare all your meals for the month ahead. You may need to invest in a larger freezer, though!Consider starting a batch-cooking club with friends or neighbors. That way, you can trade some of your dishes for some of theirs, thereby cutting back on the number of different dishes you need to make.\n",
            "Limit how often you eat out, and eat healthy when you do.\n",
            "You may want to add in a few eat-out or take-in meals per week to your meal plan, but keep them as limited as you can. Its more difficult to eat healthy this way, as opposed to when you prepare your meals yourself. When you are eating out, try the following:[16]Study the menu beforehand, ideally even before going to the restaurant.Ask for advice on healthy menu options from the restaurant staff.Eat a healthy snack beforehand, and order small portion sizes.Drink water with your meal instead of sugary beverages or alcohol.\n",

            "Choose which logs you will use.\n",
            "The best choice is a log from a fire-killed standing dead tree. A wildfire burns diseased trees to the ground, but leaves healthy trees dead but still standing. Therefore, your chances of getting good logs are best from these trees. Fire-killed wood also loses its bark, saving you time when you start building.[1] You can find fallen logs or logs that wash onto a beach or riverbank. You can also buy logs from a sawmill. However, you may find after you start working that these are rotten or have other problems that make them unsuitable.Cut live trees down to get logs if it's legal to do so. You will have to wait about a year for the wood to dry enough to build with it. Stripping the bark will help it dry faster.\n",

            "Saw 2 4-foot (1.2 m) posts and 2 3-foot (90 cm) posts to make the legs and the ends of the headboard and footboard. The posts should be cut from large, sturdy logs.Saw 4 rails to separate the posts. Measure the mattress width and cut the rails to be 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) longer. When you cut the tenons to fit the rails into the posts, they will be the width of the mattress.Cut spindles to place between the rails of the headboard and footboard. You need 36-inch (90 cm) spindles for the headboard and 24-inch (61 cm) spindles for the footboard. After cutting the tenons, they will measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter. The number of spindles you need depends on the size of the bed.Prepare 4 bed rails to connect the headpost to the foot post on each side.

            "Sign up for a Pathoma account.\n",
            "Go to www.Pathoma.com/sign-up. There you can read about the variety of membership options available, including a free 1-month trial. Most med students get the most benefit out of signing up for the 21-month access package, which gives you full video and text access. This also means that you can download materials on to your phone for 24-7 study access.[2]To sign up for an account, youll need to provide your name, address, and current school affiliation. Youll also have to agree to be the only user for your account.An account costs $84.95 for 3 months, $99.95 for 12 months, or $119.95 for 21 months.\n",
            "Put together a study group.\n",
            "Find a group of classmates or friends who are at a similar stage in medical school. Create a study schedule that you all can stick with over time. Devote at least a portion of your time each meeting to discussing Pathoma and its materials.[3]Some groups also use this as an opportunity to share a single membership to the Pathoma website, although this is prohibited according to the websites membership terms.\n",
            "Read straight through the text at least once.\n",
            "You can either do this online or with a hard copy of the book. Give yourself ample time to make your way through it in 45-minute reading segments. Try not to take notes this first go-round, just enjoy the material and try to get a feel for the full coverage of the book.[4]This is also useful if you are trying to decide between going with Pathoma or Goljans Rapid Review.The Pathoma text is over 200 pages long, so dont expect to make your way through it in only a day or 2.\n",
            "Make a flashcard for all important facts.\n",
            "Each time that you encounter a particular definition, term, or explanation that you need to know by memorization, write it on a notecard. This goes for the material found in the text, study aids, and visual materials. You can also color-code your cards by theme for easy reference.[5]For example, you can put each separate definition on a pink card.You can even sketch quick illustrations on to the cards. This can be especially useful when studying the cell structure of certain diseases.If paper cards arent your thing, use Anki or Firecracker to make electronic cards. These can be saved to your phone so that you can study anywhere and anytime.\n",
            "Teach the Pathoma site to non-medical friends or family.\n",
            "This is a creative way to approach a study session. When you are pretty comfortable with the Pathoma site, sit down with a friend and let them browse through it. Encourage them to ask lots of questions, so that you can explain what they are seeing or hearing. This lets you become the teacher, which is a great way to learn more.[6]\n",
            "Look at the same information over and over again.\n",
            "Anyone who is familiar with studying complex material knows that repetition is key. Go through your notecards until you can repeat the information back quickly and easily. Read over the same portions of the text multiple times. Watch the videos repeatedly until you can predict what comes next.\n",
            "Compare or use in combination with Goljan.\n",
            "There is another popular pathology text that many med students find useful, Dr. Goljans Rapid Review. This is a 700-page book that covers basic topics in pathology. It also explores the connections between pathology and other disciplines, such as microbiology.You can also find audio recordings of Goljans lectures on YouTube and other websites. Some publishers even include free study materials when you purchase Goljans text from them.\n",
            "Compare and contrast information with first aid.\n",
            "After you finish reading a section in your First Aid text, open your Pathoma materials and see where they overlap. This may help you to understand your First Aid lectures or information more thoroughly. After all, both texts can't cover everything, but working with them together will increase your coverage and retention.[7]\n",
            "Continue to go to lectures.\n",
            "Its really tempting to focus all of your attention on Pathoma and other study options and completely (or partially) skip your class sessions. This approach can really backfire. Attending the lectures gives you yet another layer of information. Plus, take this opportunity to write down any questions that you have and look these up later.\n",
            "Stay curious.\n",
            "Pathoma should be one of the few resources that you immediately turn to if you have a question even tangentially related to pathology. Force yourself to constantly ask questions about what you hear in lectures or have learned from other study sites.For example, if you arent familiar with a drugs name, look it up in Pathoma.\n",
            "Start with Pathoma 1-2 hours each day 2 years out from Step 1.\n",
            "When you still are a year or more away from taking the exam, your goal should be to familiarize yourself with the Pathoma text and website. Get to know its structure by browsing through the materials. Note any and all questions that you have.This is also the stage where you should begin to take general notes over the texts content.\n",
            "Quiz yourself each day if you are less than a year out from Step 1.\n",
            "This is when you need to transition your studying to fit your test-taking goals. Set aside 30 minutes each day for quizzing yourself over your Pathoma notecards or question sets. Keep track of your weak areas and target those in subsequent days.For example, if a certain Pathoma chapter is your weakest subject area, then spend extra time getting it down.\n",
            "Study 6-8 hours per day when you are 6-12 weeks out from the test.\n",
            "Not all of this study time should be spent on Pathoma, but some of it should. Use Pathoma as a reference as you answer world bank questions. Add new notecards to cover more complex concepts. Watch a Pathoma video segment to break up your on-paper preparation.The website www.uworld.com provides a comprehensive collection of questions for students planning to take the Step 1 exam. These questions are generally referred to as world bank questions.\n",

            "Introduce yourself.\n",
            "Include your name, where you are from, and your age in the letter. Mention your personal connection to the person or the work that they do. You can also mention anything that you and the person may have in common.[1]If you are writing to your favorite basketball player, you might say, \"Hello, my name is ___. I am ___ years old, and I am from ___.  I have been playing basketball since elementary school.\"If you were writing to your favorite singer, you may say, \"Hi, I'm ____ from ___. I'm ___ years old. I love to sing and write music just like you do.\"\n",
            "Be specific.\n",
            "Are you writing to compliment a specific thing they did?  Are you writing a general \"I love you\" letter? Did the person make a positive impact on your life or inspire you? Write what you feel.[2]This will make your letter feel more sincere and genuine.For example, instead of saying \"I like your music,\" say \"I am a big fan of your music. My favorite song/album is ___. Your music helped get through ___.\"\n",
            "Keep the letter short.\n",
            "The person you are sending the letter to probably receives a lot of fan mail. Keep your letter short and to the point. If your letter is too long, the person may not read all of it. You are also more likely to get a response if your letter is short.[3]If you type your letter, limit it to one page, single-spaced.[4]If your letter is specific, you should have no problem keeping the letter short.\n",
            "Do not include too much personal information.\n",
            "Although you may admire and look up to the person you are writing a letter to, the person is still a stranger. Do not include any information beyond your name, age, and address.  This is to keep you safe. Sending your address will increase the chances of you getting a response, autograph, or fan club gift.Also avoid sending any personal items that you want to get back.  For example, you would not send your only copy of a picture or item that you wanted the person to sign. You may or may not get a response, and you will have lost that item forever.\n",
            "Ask for a response.\n",
            "If you would like for the person to respond to you or send you an autograph let them know. They may or may not respond, but it never hurts to ask. It is best to not expect to hear back. If you do hear back, it will be a nice surprise. Be specific if you want something back. For example, you may say, \"I would love an autographed picture from you. Thank you so much.\"Avoid asking questions in your letter and expecting the person to respond.\n",
            "Do not write anything creepy or inappropriate.\n",
            "Your letter should simply tell the person that you enjoy what they do, and how it has had a positive effect on you.[5] Do not ask for any personal information, ask to come visit them, threaten them, or talk about anything sexual. You do not want to make the person feel uncomfortable or seem like a stalker.It is against the law to threaten a person through the mail. You could go to jail or have to pay a fine. [6]If you would not be comfortable saying the content of the letter to the person's face, you probably shouldn't write it to them either.\n",
            "Obtain their address.\n",
            "Visit the person's website to find their address. The person may have a special address for people to send fan mail to. If you do not find a specific address for the person, you may be able to find the address for their manager, agent, or publisher.For example, if you send your letter to a writer, send the letter to the company that publishes their books and write \"Attention: Name of Writer\" on the address.Many celebrities have official fan club websites and official websites. Make sure you send your letter to the address from the official website.[7]\n",
            "Include other items with your letter.\n",
            "You may want to send a photograph or some fan art that you created. This is a nice way to add a personal touch and give the person a gift.  Many celebrities display fan art on their social media pages.You could send a picture of yourself at the person's concert or in front of an advertisement they are in.If the person is on the cover of a magazine, take a picture of you holding the magazine and send it to them.If you're creative, you could draw a picture of the person and send it to them.\n",
            "Have enough postage.\n",
            "Once you have your letter ready, place it in an envelope and send it. Make sure you have enough postage on the envelope. You may need more postage if the envelope is thick and/or heavy.Also consider the destination. If you are mailing a letter overseas or to another country, you will need more postage than usual.Visit the United States Postal Service (USPS) website to use their postage calculator.[8]\n",
            "Write an email.\n",
            "An email should contain the same content as a written letter, but it should be a little bit shorter. Like written letters, the person may have a special email address for fan mail. Visit the person's website and look for an area that says something similar to \"contact me.\"Limit your email to  4 or 5 sentences.If the person does not have a website, visit one of their social media pages and look for their contact information.\n",
            "Comment on a social media post.\n",
            "Another way to contact a celebrity is by commenting on their social media posts. Instagram and Facebook allow you to comment on particular posts. You will not be able to write as much as you would in a letter, but this is a quick way to show your appreciation.Look through previous posts to find out if the celebrity usually responds to and interacts with fans. If this is the case, you may be able to get a response.Even if the person does not respond to your comment, they may read what you wrote.You may get a quicker response by interacting with the person through social media than through sending a written letter.[9]\n",
            "Send a direct message.\n",
            "You can send the person a direct message on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. If you do not want other people to see what you write, this is the best way to go. Keep your message short and to the point.Do not bombard the person with direct messages every single day. This will not make them respond to you.Also, do not contact a person using all of the methods at once. For example, do not comment, send an email, and send a direct message. This can make you look bad.\n",

            "Your body turns them into energy that's stored in your muscles.\n",
            "Around 50-60% of your daily calories should come from carbs so you have plenty of fuel for your workouts. Although it's easy to fill up on carbs, reach for high-quality carbs that give you fiber and nutrients, like whole grains.[1] For example, add these to your daily diet:[2]Oats, brown rice, and quinoaSweet potatoes and potatoesFruits like bananas, mangoes, avocadoes, and peachesVegetables like Brussels sprouts, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower\n",
            "Give your body longer-lasting energy from nutritious protein sources.\n",
            "Protein is also a great way to get more calories so you don't continue to lose weight. Try to get about 25% of your calories from protein. You might eat lean meat, tofu, nuts, or beans, for instance.[3][4]Protein shakes are also a great way to get calories throughout the day. You might sip one an hour before a workout or drink one before you go to bed.\n",
            "Eat monosaturated fats so your body can release hormones that build muscle.\n",
            "Drizzle heart-healthy fats like olive oil, canola oil, or coconut oil over your food, or eat foods that are naturally high in healthy fats like avocados, salmon, sardines, and trout. Try to get 20 to 35% of your daily calories from monosaturated fat.[5]Skip the unhealthy fats found in fast food and packaged snacks since these are high in saturated- and trans-fats.\n",
            "Eat an extra 500 calories a day to support muscle growth.\n",
            "If you're working out more and building muscle, your body needs more calories so you don't lose more weight. Aim for an extra 500 calories spread out across your meals.[6]Remember to reach for nutritious food instead of filling up on high-calorie snacks or convenience foods.500 calories might sound like a lot, but if you add a few snacks to your daily diet, you can usually reach this. Try a handful of nuts, protein shakes, smoothies, or hardboiled eggs with crackers.\n",
            "Reach for a fast-digesting carbohydrate and protein to give you energy.\n",
            "You don't want to wear out too soon into your workout so fuel up beforehand. Snack on a piece of toast with nut butter and jam, for instance, or grab some grapes and a handful of nuts.[7]Drink water or a sports drink along with your pre-workout snack.If you're going to work out for more than 1 hour, you may need to eat another small snack. For example, eat a rice cake with a hardboiled egg or a piece of cheese with a few berries.\n",
            "Re-fuel your body so you can repair muscles and store energy.\n",
            "If you're skinny, your body needs extra calories to build and support muscles so eat a meal that's high in carbohydrates once you've finished exercising. Aim for 3 or 4 parts carbohydrates to 1 part protein.[8]For example, eat a bowl of hot amaranth cereal with dried fruit and nuts or chia seeds.\n",
            "Lift weights about 4 days a week.\n",
            "To bulk up and tone your muscles, use high-resistance weights with a low number of repetitions. Specifically, aim to do 3 to 5 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions for each muscle group. To make your weight-training schedule interesting, you can switch up your focus each day. For example, on:[9]Day 1: work your chest and triceps with dips, overhead extensions, and incline dumbbell pressDay 2: work your back and biceps with seated barbell curls and wide-grip pull-upsDay 3: work your legs and shoulders with leg presses, leg curls, and deadliftsDay 4: restDay 5: do a total body workout where you target all of your major muscle groupsReader Poll: We asked 121 wikiHow readers and 64% of them agreed that the best exercise for gaining muscle is doing squats with added weight. [Take Poll]\n",
            "Take a day off every 3 or 4 days so your muscles can repair and recover.\n",
            "You may work out Monday through Wednesday and take Thursday off, for instance. Then, do slower cardio work on the weekends. Don't forget to get plenty of rest every day, too. Try to sleep at least 8 hours a night so your body. Your body releases the majority of its growth hormones while you sleep, which is why a good night's rest is critical.[10]If you're extra tired from working out, take naps! You can also rest and relax by getting deep-tissue massages.\n",
            "Stick to 30-minute aerobic workouts so you don't burn too many calories.\n",
            "High-intensity aerobic activities like running burn a lot of calories so you might find it hard to build muscle. Instead, plan on doing low-intensity activities no more than 3 times a week. Keep in mind that some days you'll be doing cardio and weights. This keeps up your cardiovascular health, but you shouldn't lose more weight. Low-intensity aerobic activities include:[11]Walking up and down hillsDoing a stair-climber machineCycling in a high gearWalking on your treadmill\n",
            "Find ways to build muscle even when you're not doing a workout.\n",
            "It can be hard to carve out workout time, but staying active is important for gaining muscle mass. If you're pretty sedentary during the day, try to get up and walk around or stretch every 30 minutes.[12]Just being more active every day can help you maintain the muscles that you've worked so hard to build.\n",

            "Gather and shuffle together a 52-card deck for each player at the table.\n",
            "Hand and foot is played with 4-6 players. Add a full deck of cards to the game for each player at the table (e.g. if youre playing with 4 players, use 4 decks), then  shuffle together all the decks to make 1 large deck.[1] This large deck is referred to as the stock.Since Hand and Foot is played with many cards at once, start by shuffling each deck independently. Then, shuffle 2 decks together, divide the 2 shuffled decks in half, and shuffle them with other shuffled decks to thoroughly mix up the cards.[2]\n",
            "Deal 11 cards to each player, twice.\n",
            "Working clockwise around the table, deal cards face-down until each player has a stack of 11 cards in front of them. Instruct players to keep these cards face-down in a stackno peeking! This first stack is known as the foot, and each player will use their foot later in the game. Then, deal each player a handanother 11 cardsand allow them to examine them. These are the cards players will use first.If you're playing with teams (2 players to a team), have team members sit across from each other at the table during the deal, and as they play the game.Some variations of the game have players try to take stacks of exactly 22 cards from the deck instead of a deal. If theyre successful, they earn 300 points right away.\n",
            "Turn over the top card of the stock to create a discard pile.\n",
            "Place the stock in the center of the table, then turn over the stocks top card and place it next to the stock. This face-up card begins the discard, where players will discard 1 card after their turn, and optionally take new cards at the start of their turns.[3]\n",
            "Draw 2 cards from the stock and check your hand for sets of at least 3.\n",
            "The person to the left of the dealer begins the game. Draw 2 cards from the stock at the center of the table, and incorporate them into your hand (ignoring your foot cards for now). Examine your hand for possible melds (sets of at least 3 cards of the same value).[4]Or, instead of drawing 2 cards from the stock, draw 5 cards from the discard pile (or the entire discard, if there are fewer than 5 cards).\n",
            "Create a new meld on the table, or add cards to existing melds.\n",
            "The object of Hand and Foot is to play all the cards in your hand and foot piles, and to do that, players make melds in the center of the table. To make a meld, place at least 3 cards of the same value in the center of the table (such as three 6s). Or, you may add cards from your hand onto existing melds of the same value, if there are any on the table.[5]Note that melding in Hand and Foot comes with a fairly in-depth set of its own rules and procedures. For complete guidelines, see the  Melding Section of this article.A player may only make new melds or lay cards onto their own existing melds, but not both. If laying cards onto existing melds, they may lay cards into multiple melds.If youre playing with teams, teammates may only add new cards onto their teammates or their own melds.\n",
            "Pick up and play with your foot pile when your hand runs out.\n",
            "Immediately after you discard or meld the last card in your hand, pick up your face-down foot pile and use it to play the game as normal. If you use up your hand in the middle of your turn, your turn continues using your foot pile.[6]That said, if you use up your hand by discarding, your turn ends immediately, and youll use your foot pile on your next and subsequent turns.\n",
            "Discard 1 card and continue playing until a player has no cards.\n",
            "After playing cards into melds, discard any card from your hand into the face-up discard pile. Then, the person to your left takes their turn, making melds or laying cards.[7] Continue taking turns clockwise around the table until 1 player discards or melds their last card.If youre playing with teams, keep playing until the second partner has played at least 1 card from their foot pile.\n",
            "Tally your score, shuffle and deal the cards, and play 3 more rounds.\n",
            "After a player has gotten rid of all their cards,  count up your score. Then, gather and shuffle all the cards together, and deal 22 cards to each player as before. Hand and Foot is played in 4 rounds, so play 3 more rounds in the same way you played the first. Whoever has the most points at the end of round 4 wins the game![8]\n",
            "Create melds of certain values each round.\n",
            "In each of the 4 rounds, the cards of a players (or teams) first meld played that round must add up to at least 50 points in the first round, 90 points in the second round, 120 points in the third, and 150 points in the fourth round. After this first meld is made, new melds by that player or team dont need to add up to any certain value. Players may reach the point threshold with multiple melds, if they choose. Card values are as follows:[9]4-7: 5 points8-Kings: 10 pointsAces & 2: 20 pointsJokers: 50 points3s cannot be melded.Wild cards (jokers and 2s) may be played in place of any other card.\n",
            "Complete melds of 7 cards, which are known as books.\n",
            "Once a player or a team has created a meld of 7 cards, that meld is set aside and becomes a completed book. New cards cannot be added to completed books. A book that was made with no wild cards is called a clean book and is worth 500 points at the end of the round, while one made with wild cards, which is known as a dirty book, is worth 300.[10]Once you make a book, stack the cards into a pile and set them aside. Place a red card from the meld face-up on top if its a clean meld, or a black card if its a dirty meld, to help you tell them apart later.Because dirty melds are easier to play, usually it's wise to save these plays for later in the game.\n",
            "Win points for each meld after someone gets rid of all their cards.\n",
            "Immediately after someone gets rid of the last card of their foot pile, either with a meld or a discard, end the round and tally the score. Each team earns points for the melds they turned into books: 500 points for each clean book and 300 points for each dirty book. This is your base score.[11]The player or team who got rid of their cards, or went out, also gets an extra 300 points.\n",
            "Add points to your score from each melded card.\n",
            "You also win points for each card you melded, even if theyre already in a book. Count up the point values of each card in your melds on the table, and add them to your base score.[12] The card values are the same as before, but 3s now subtract points. Write this score down, and keep adding to it after each round, for all 4 rounds.4-7: 5 points8-Kings: 10 pointsAces & 2 (wild): 20 pointsJokers (wild): 50 pointsRed 3s: -100 pointsBlack 3s: -5 points\n",
            "Subtract points from your score for each card in your hand and foot.\n",
            "If youre caught at the end of the round with cards still in your hand or foot piles, you receive a penalty. Add up the values of each card still in your hand and foot, then subtract that amount from your total score.[13] To earn the most points, try to meld as many cards onto the table as possible, so youre not stuck with them at the end of the round!\n",

            "4 Ways to Learn the Spelling of Words Quickly - wikiHow\n",
            "Break down the word.\n",
            "When you think of a word you don't know how to spell, don't panic. Step back and break the word into parts, either in your head or with pen and paper. Even when the spelling doesn't match the sound, this method will teach you to recognize common spelling patterns.[1]Example: Break \"constraint\" into \"con  strain  t.\" The second and third part are spelled how they sound. The vowel in \"con\" might not be obvious from the sound, but if you keep breaking down words you'll notice that the spelling \"con\" appears many times.\n",
            "Identify prefixes and suffixes.\n",
            "Many English words are formed from two or more parts. When possible, break words down into a \"root word,\" a \"prefix\" at the beginning, and/or a \"suffix\" at the end. Each prefix or suffix appears on many words, and almost always has the same meaning and spelling each time.[2]Example: Break \"independence\" into \"in  depend  ence\":1.\"In\" is a prefix that means \"not\"2. \"Depend\" is the root word3. The suffix \"ence\" is probably the hardest to spell, but you only need to learn it once and you'll recognize it at the end of many words.\n",
            "Guess at spellings based on other words.\n",
            "When you have no idea how to spell part of a word, write down other words that include a similar sound. Chances are good that the mystery word is spelled the same way. This isn't foolproof, but it's much better than choosing a spelling at random.Example: \"Independence\" might sound like it ends with an \"s\" at first  but \"fence\" has a much closer sound than \"pens.\" This makes the \"ence\" spelling more likely to be correct (which it is).\n",
            "Memorize extra difficult words by pronouncing each syllable.\n",
            "Some words have such weird spellings that they are difficult to remember even after breaking them into parts. Try ignoring the real pronunciation and instead pronouncing each syllable as it's written.Example: The military rank \"colonel\" is pronounced \"kernel,\" which doesn't sound anything like the spelling. To help you memorize the spelling, chant the word as it looks: \"col  o - nel.\"Example 2: This trick is especially useful for long words. Say the word \"congratulation\" as \"con-grat-u-la-ti-on.\" Once you're 100% sure about the \"tion\" ending, you can shorten this to \"con-grat-u-la-shun.\"Exaggerate the vowel sounds to make sure they sound different from each other. E, I, and A are easily confused if you're not careful.\n",
            "Make a visual connection between a difficult and easy word.\n",
            "People are much better at remembering images than spelling. If you keep making a spelling mistake, come up with a simple visual idea that connects the difficult word with an easy word that has a similar spelling.Example: The word \"gherkin\" (meaning pickle) has the same \"gh\" start as the word \"ghost.\" Think of a ghost holding a gherkin, and you'll train your brain to think \"gherkin  ghost  they both start with 'gh'.\"Making connections to an unrelated idea is often helpful when you're trying to memorize any information. This technique is called a \"donkey bridge.\"[3]\n",
            "Remember the appearance of the word on the page.\n",
            "If you can't think of a word to connect it to, there's another way to create a visual idea, although it can take some creativity. Write the difficult word in large letters on a piece of paper. Focus on the letter or letters you have trouble with, and draw (or imagine) a picture that looks like those letters. It may help to include the meaning of the word in your image.Example: If you keep spelling \"citadel\" (meaning castle) with two \"L\"s, picture a citadel with a single, tall tree to the right of it. This may remind you that there's only one \"l\" at the end of the word.\n",
            "Try to write a mnemonic for each spelling.\n",
            "A mnemonic is a silly phrase that's easy to remember and tells you something about the word. One easy way to make a mnemonic is to write a sentence by turning each letter into a full word. Silly but simple sentences are best.[4]Example: To remember the spelling of \"because,\" think of \"Big Elephants Can't Always Use Small Exits.\"\n",
            "Learn the meaning of the word.\n",
            "You're much more likely to remember a word if you're comfortable with its definition. This doesn't just mean memorizing the vocab list. Try to use it in a sentence, or search online for examples of how people use the word in writing.\n",
            "Make flash cards and carry them around wherever you go.\n",
            "Whenever you have a spare five minutes, quiz yourself with them.[5]\n",
            "Write each word on a different sticky note.\n",
            "Stick a spelling on every wall of your room, item on your desk, and anywhere else you run into them. Include the meaning of the word on the sticky note.If you're studying words in a foreign language, stick the notes to the objects they describe. For spelling in your native language, just stick them anywhere.\n",
            "Write the word repeatedly.\n",
            "Think of Bart Simpson at the chalkboard. Writing out a word that many times gets boring fast, but sometimes it's the only way to make it stick in your head.\n",
            "Smell something pleasant while studying.\n",
            "The sense of smell is closely linked to memory.[6] If you sniff the same scent while you study and when you take the test, it may boost your ability to remember what you learned. Dried flowers or scented soap are a couple examples of strong-smelling objects you can bring to school.\n",
            "Read in your spare time.\n",
            "[7] Reading will improve your spelling without you even realizing it. Each word you read is another reminder of how that word is spelled. And as the exercises above showed, even knowing how to spell simple words can help you spell words you've never seen before.[8]When you find a word you don't know, spell it out loud. Write down the word a few times.\n",
            "Pick a few words to learn at a time.\n",
            "When you find a useful or interesting word while reading, in conversation, or in class, write it down. Every day, write down each word on your list three times and spell it out loud. Literally one minute of this \"studying\" each day will teach you the spelling quite quickly. Remove words from the list once you're confident you know the spelling. Add new words to replace them.[9]\n",
            "Turn off auto correct.\n",
            "If your phone or computer correct your spelling for you, you're missing a chance to reinforce the correct spellings. Turn off this feature so you don't reinforce bad habits by entering the wrong spelling repeatedly.[10]\n",

            "Pierce the bottom of a thinner dread with a bobby pin.\n",
            "Pick a dread that has a softer, rather than a harder, end. Often times, if wax or other products are used on dreads, it can create stiff sections, so try your best to find an end that has a little bit of give when you squeeze it. Take one side of the bobby pin and push it through the dread, about  inch (0.64cm) from the end.[1]Avoid using bigger dreads for this method, as the end of the dread needs to be thin enough to fit through the hole in the cowrie shell.\n",
            "Thread the bobby pin through the hole in the center of the cowrie shell.\n",
            "Once the bobby pin is attached to your dread, take both ends and push them straight through that center hole in the shell. It doesnt matter which side of the shell is facing out.[3]Some cowrie shells dont have holes through their centers. Buy ones that are sliced so that you can easily add them to your dreads.\n",
            "Work the shell up the bobby pin and over the end of your dread.\n",
            "Once the shell reaches the end of your dread, gently pull the tip of the hair through the shell about  inch (0.64cm). Avoid yanking your hair and instead gently wiggle it back and forth until the end comes through the shell.[4]If you yank too hard or are too aggressive, you risk splitting or fraying the end of your dread.\n",
            "Remove the bobby pin from your dread.\n",
            "Leaving the shell in place on the end of your dread, simply push the bobby pin out of your loc. Set it down on the counter or somewhere it wont get lost.[5]Be careful to not accidentally snag the shell on anything at this stageit could easily come off your dread and make you have to repeat the process all over again.\n",
            "Fold the end of your dread up over the edge of the shell.\n",
            "Take the end of the dread that is poking through the cowrie shell and bring it up so it meets the rest of your dread. If you find you need a little more length, go ahead and gently tug your dread through the shell a little bit further.[6]You may be tempted to just leave the shell dangling on the edge of your dread, but dont skip the last step. Otherwise, you might find yourself losing shells as you go about your day.\n",
            "Secure the shell by wrapping a small elastic around your dread.\n",
            "Take a small hair elastic and wrap it around the section of hair just above the cowrie shell. Depending on how thick your dread is, wrap the elastic around 3 to 4 (or more) times. Take the shells out when you tire of the look or when it comes time to wash your dreads.[7]Try to use an elastic that matches your hair color if you dont want the elastic to be noticeable.For a fun twist, try using colored elastics in an array of colors, or you could even match them to your outfit for the day.\n",
            "Thread a small hair elastic through the hole in the center of the shell.\n",
            "Take a single hair elastic and push one end through the center of the cowrie shell so that half of the elastic is coming out the front and half of it is coming out the back. This can be a little tricky since the elastic is so small, so take your time and be patient![8]If you are having a hard time getting the elastic through, try threading a bobby pin through the elastic and pushing that through the shell. Just remember to remove the bobby pin once the elastic is in place.\n",
            "Create a knot by looping one end of the elastic over the other one.\n",
            "Essentially, youll want to pass one side of the elastic underneath and through the other side and then pull it tightly so that it creates a circle. Do your best to keep a finger through the circle so that you dont lose hold of the elastic.[9]When this is done, the cowrie shell should resemble a hair tie with a bead or bobble attached to it.\n",
            "Pick a position for the cowrie shell on one of your dreads.\n",
            "The great thing about this method is that it allows you to place the shell wherever you would like, from the top to the middle to the bottom. You can really have fun placing them all over your hair in different positions for a cool look.[10]You can also add multiple shells to the same dread using this method.\n",
            "Secure the shell by wrapping the elastic around your dread a few times.\n",
            "Once youve picked the place for your shell, simply thread your dread through the elastic. Depending on how thick your dread is, you may need to wrap the elastic around it 2 to 3 times (or more, if you have really thin dreads). You can leave your shells in place for a day or until you tire of the look or need to wash your hair.[11]When youre ready to remove the shell, you can simply undo the elastic, or you could carefully cut the elastic with a pair of scissors to release the shell.\n",

            "Give icing or other home remedies a try.\n",
            "Sandflies are a common nuisance in many parts of the world, so there are many home remedies available online. Some people, for instance, find temporary relief by holding an ice pack wrapped in a washcloth over any bites for up to 10 minutes per hour.[1]Icing, in fact, seems to be the most medically-proven way to relieve itchy bug bites.[2]Other home remedies include: aloe vera gel, blue gel toothpaste; mentholated topical ointments (such as Vicks VapoRub); tea tree oil diluted in a carrier oil; baking soda and water mixed into a paste; soaking in a warm bath with a cupful of powdered oatmeal mixed in.[3]\n",
            "Dab hydrocortisone cream onto the bite to manage your symptoms.\n",
            "Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can reduce pain and inflammation from a bug bite. Read and follow the instructions on your hydrocortisone cream. Apply a small amount of cream directly onto your bite, but keep the cream off of your healthy skin.[4]Don't use hydrocortisone cream for longer than 7 days unless your doctor tells you to do so.[5]\n",
            "Try antiseptic, anti-itch, and/or soothing lotions on itchy bites.\n",
            "You can find a range of products marketed for soothing bug bites, though there is limited evidence that they actually make much difference. Try different products for 2-3 days at a time and see if any one in particular works best for you.[6]Always follow the product instructions carefully and contact your doctor first if you have any concerns about side effects or drug interactions.[7]You might try, for instance, a gel containing 2% lidocaine or 1% hydrocortisone.\n",
            "Try an antihistamine lotion or tablets for more serious itching.\n",
            "The itchiness associated with sandfly bites is caused by your bodys histamine response to the insects saliva in the wound. Try applying a pea-sized or smaller dab of a topical antihistamine to each bite mark. Follow the product instructions for how often to apply the lotion.[8]If you have numerous sandfly bites, you might have better results from taking an oral antihistaminesuch as 10 mg cetirizine or loratadineinstead. Once again, follow the product instructions.You can buy topical and oral antihistamines over the counter (OTC), but it never hurts to contact your doctor before using an antihistamine.As with other OTC bug bite remedies, there is limited evidence that oral or topical antihistamines make much of a difference.[9]\n",
            "Apply calamine lotion as another possible remedy.\n",
            "Shake up the bottle of calamine lotion, then apply a small amount to a cotton ball. Dab a thin coating of the lotion over each itchy bite mark and allow it to dry for 2-3 minutes before covering it with any clothing. Keep the lotion on for up to 3 hours before wiping it away with a damp cloth, and reapply it as often as needed.[10]Follow the product instructions or your doctors advice for specific guidance on using calamine lotion.If you develop a rash or irritation, stop using calamine lotion.Once again, the evidence for calamine lotion's effectiveness in soothing bug bites is limited at best.[11]\n",
            "Take an over-the-counter pain reliever if your sandfly bites hurt.\n",
            "Ask your doctor if it's safe for you to take over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). These medications will help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Take the medication as directed on the label.[12]If you can't take NSAIDs, ask your doctor if you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief.\n",
            "Resist the urge to scratch the itchy bites!\n",
            "While scratching an itchy sandfly bite can provide very temporary relief, it runs a high risk of making the problem worse. Scratching can break open the skin and introduce bacteria, which in turn can cause the bite to become infected. In this case, youll need to see your doctor.[13]The bite may be infected if the swelling or redness increases, if you feel warmth in the area of the bite, if theres any discharge from the bite, or if you get a fever. Contact your doctor if this occurs, whether or not youve been scratching the bite.You may need to use topical or oral antibiotics if the bite becomes infected.\n",
            "Cover your skinespecially legs, ankles, and feetwith light-colored clothing.\n",
            "Simply put, sandflies cant bite your skin if they cant get to it! Wear shoes, long socks, pants, and a long sleeve shirt if possible, and tuck your shirt into your pants. Stick to light colors as well, since sandflies seem to be more attracted to darker colors.[14]Focus especially on your feet, ankles, and lower legs, since this is where sandflies tend to bite most often. You may want to tuck your pants into your socks.\n",
            "Steer clear of bodies of water during dawn and dusk.\n",
            "Most varieties of sandflies stay within about 10m (33ft) of a body of moving water, such as an ocean, lake, or river. Additionally, they tend to be most active during dawn and dusk hours. By avoiding these conditions, you can greatly reduce your risk of being bitten.[15]Not all sandfly varieties follow this pattern, howeversome types are more active during mid-day sunshine, for instance. Ask locals for some insider info on the native sandfly varieties and how best to avoid them.\n",
            "Use an insect repellent containing DEET when going outdoors.\n",
            "Follow the product instructions and spray the repellent on exposed skin, with a particular focus on any areas of exposed skin below the knees. You can also spray it on your clothing where it meets exposed skinlike the cuffs of your shirt and pantsalthough some repellents may stain certain fabrics.[16]Insect repellents that contain DEET are safe to use on children, but use the lowest amount that's effective. Alternatively, use an insect repellent that contains natural ingredients if it's effective.[17]Repellents containing DEET seem to be most effective in keeping away sandflies, but you can try alternate chemical or natural repellents instead.\n",
            "Know your risk for this illness based on where you live or travel.\n",
            "Leishmaniasis is an infection caused by parasites that are introduced to your body when bitten by an infected sandfly. While very rare in many parts of the world, including North America, Australia and New Zealand, and most of Europe, it is more common in certain other areas.[19]If you live in or are traveling to Central or South America, the Middle East, North or Central Africa, southern Europe, or tropical parts of Asia, you may be at higher risk of getting leishmaniasis from sandfly bites.If youre in an area with an elevated risk, its important to take measures to avoid getting sandfly bites. These include wearing long clothing, applying insect repellent with DEET, and avoiding moving bodies of water during dawn and dusk.\n",
            "Watch for signs of cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis.\n",
            "Cutaneous leishmaniasis is far more common, and often presents on the skin as raised red bumps or even ulcers that scab over or ooze from the middle. In short, your sandfly bite will appear infected and should be evaluated by a doctor.[20]Visceral leishmaniasis is more rare and involves an infection of your internal organs. Instead of watching for signs of infection at the site of the bite, keep an eye out for fever, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. Your doctor will check for abnormal blood test results, low blood counts, and swelling of the spleen and liver.If you experience these symptoms but havent been in an area where leishmaniasis is endemic, you likely have another type of infection. You should still go to your doctor for an evaluation.\n",
            "Discuss potential treatments for cutaneous leishmaniasis with your doctor.\n",
            "In most cases, cutaneous leishmaniasis will go away on its own over a period of weeks to months. Therefore, active treatment is not always recommended. In some cases, though, your doctor may recommend one of several medications for this condition.[21]Some types of cutaneous leishmaniasis (especially types found in Central and South America) can spread to the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat. Active treatment is more likely if this is a possibility in your case.Most cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis dont cause long-term medical problems, although you may experience scarring where the bumps or ulcers form.\n",
            "Undergo treatment right away if you have visceral leishmaniasis.\n",
            "Because it affects key internal organs such as your liver, visceral leishmaniasis must be treated as soon as possible.  The first line of treatment is likely to be one of several medication options, but some cases may require surgical interventions or even organ transplants.[22]When detected early on, visceral leishmaniasis can usually be treated successfully. Advanced cases, however, are often fatal. This is why its so essential to keep an eye out for signs of infection if youve been in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic.\n",

            "Soak the wood you want to bend in water for at least a day before steaming.\n",
            "This will make the wood much easier to bend after steaming. Place the lumber you want to bend in a container full of water, completely submerged, and soak it overnight before you steam it.Its possible to steam bend wood without soaking it overnight if you arent able to do so. Keep in mind that air-dried lumber is easier to steam than kiln-dried lumber. Woods with more open grain, for example oak, are the most easy to steam bend.\n",
            "Place the moist wood into a steam box.\n",
            "A steam box may be constructed from wood or PVC pipe. The steam box needs to be big enough to let the steam flow around the piece of wood and needs openings, like drilled holes, so that the steam gets airflow and does not become volatile.[1]You can buy a steam box from a home improvement center or construct your own steam box from lumber, like plywood, or from PVC piping. A steam box is essentially just an enclosure that opens at 1 end and has a hose running into it from a steam generator.If possible, work outside when you are steam bending wood. Steam gets very hot, so be incredibly careful around the steam box and generator. Wear heat-resistant gloves and safety goggles while you are steaming and bending the wood.\n",
            "Hook up a steam generator to the steam box with a hose.\n",
            "A steam generator may be store bought or you can use an appliance like a wallpaper steamer. Attach the steam generator to the steam box via a hose or tube. Wallpaper steamers are the most recommended way of creating a homemade steam generator. They are available cheaply at most home decorating stores.If you made a homemade steam box, you can drill a hole to fit the hose or tube that connects to the steam generator.\n",
            "Steam the wood for 1 hour for every 1in (2.5cm) of thickness.\n",
            "Fill the steam generators tank with water and turn it on. The general rule for steam bending wood is 1 hour for every 1in (2.5cm) of thickness of the piece of wood that you are processing, but since all woods are different the time can vary.If you dont steam the wood for long enough, then it will snap when you try to bend it. Its a good idea to do a test on a scrap piece of the same wood you want to bend to get the correct amount of time down.\n",
            "Maintain the temperature at about 212F (100C).\n",
            "This is the temperature that water boils at, so as long as you have proper ventilation in your steam box the temperature should stay close to this number. Open the steam box door to reduce pressure and temperature if it gets more than 2 degrees higher than this.You can monitor the temperature in the steam box by inserting a thermometer, like standard kitchen thermometer, into an opening (like one of the ventilation holes). You can add more ventilation to your steam box by drilling holes if you have difficulty maintaining the temperature.\n",
            "Remove the steamed wood with heat-resistant gloves when the time is up.\n",
            "Turn off the steam generator and carefully open the steam box with heat-resistant gloves. Remove the steamed piece of wood and begin the bending process as fast as possible before it loses its pliability.Make sure you have everything ready for bending before you remove the wood from the steam box so you can get started right away.\n",
            "Insert the piece of wood you want to steam completely inside a plastic bag.\n",
            "Use a plastic bag or plastic sheet tubing that is big enough to cover the whole piece of wood from end to end. Make your own out of PVC sheeting if you cant find a bag big enough.[2]Make sure to leave the ends of the bag open for ventilation. If the bag only has 1 open end, then cut a hole in the other end so the steam can escape from both sides.\n",
            "Clamp the bag with the wood to the side of something or set it on saw horses.\n",
            "Use clamps to secure the wood to the side of a workbench or other support. Set it on saw horses if you dont have anything to clamp it to.The idea is to suspend it in the air to allow the steam to flow around the wood in the bag as much as possible.Try to steam wood outside whenever possible. Steaming inside can get very hot, and the humidity can damage other tools in your shop.\n",
            "Cut a hole in the plastic bag and insert the hose of your steam generator.\n",
            "Make a small incision in the middle of the plastic bag just big enough to insert the hose from the steam generator. Put the tip of the hose in.[3]You can use tape to secure the hose in place if it doesnt stay on its own.\n",
            "Steam at 212F (100C) for 1 hour for every 1in (2.5cm) of wood.\n",
            "This is the temperature that water boils and generates steam at, so as long as your bag has sufficient ventilation it will stay at that temperature. Multiply the thickness of the wood by 1 hour for every 1in (2.5cm) to determine how long to steam it.[4]Monitor the temperature with a meat thermometer.

            "Focus on crowning more pieces than your opponent.\n",
            "In checkers, the person who has more kings also has the advantage. Try to crown as many pieces as possible to increase your chances of winning the game.[1]To put this advice into practice, advance a piece toward an area on your board where your opponent has fewer pieces, or pieces that are more spread out. If you can protect this piece with nearby pieces and sacrifices, then you have a good chance at making a king.See Intermediate Strategies below for how to \"redirect the enemy\" and sneak through a king.\n",
            "Keep your back row in place until you need to move those checkers.\n",
            "It's impossible for your opponent to crown his or her pieces if your back row is occupied, so this strategy will prevent your opponent from getting the advantage too soon in the game. You will also have more movement options left when you do start moving your back row pieces.[2]Remember that you won't be able to keep your back row intact forever. Once you're low on pieces or you see an opportunity for an advantageous trade, don't hesitate to move out.\n",
            "Advance pieces in close groups and in tandem.\n",
            "Two pieces \"in tandem\" are adjacent to each other on a diagonal line. Keeping pieces near enough to form tandem in one move makes it much harder for your opponent to capture them.[3][4]\"Following\" a piece you moved earlier before you move it again will leave your front piece less open to capture. Following it with two pieces is even safer, since you can block capture from two directions.See Intermediate Strategies to learn how to form \"trapping pairs\".\n",
            "Trade checkers when you're ahead.\n",
            "It's obvious that trading one of your checkers for two of your opponent's checkers benefits you, but even trading one for one is useful if you had more checkers to begin with.[5]For example, if you have 5 checkers and your opponent has 4 checkers, then the board is almost equal. But once you trade three pieces each, you have a huge advantage with twice as many pieces as your opponent.\n",
            "Control the center of the board.\n",
            "If you keep a few pieces near the center, you will keep your options open and be able to move rapidly to whichever side of the board needs your attention. Likewise, preventing your opponent from placing pieces in the center will deny him or her this advantage.[6]It takes practice to judge how many pieces you need to commit to the center in a particular game. As a general rule, you should try to build up enough of a position that the opponent is unable to safely advance anywhere except the left and right edges. After that goal is achieved, adding more of your pieces can actually clog up your board and lower your options.\n",
            "Sacrifice pieces to gain advantages.\n",
            "The \"forced capture\" rule requires a player to make a capture if they are able to. Think ahead to what the board will look like if you force your opponent to capture your piece and you might discover it's worth the sacrifice.If you're trying to crown a piece but your opponent is pursuing it, you can sacrifice a less important piece to lure the pursuer away from your soon-to-be king.[7]If you have a diagonal line of pieces, moving the forward one toward the enemy can force a capture that places the enemy piece next to another of yours. Make sure you don't open yourself up to a double capture![8]\n",
            "Try a \"Trapping Pairs\" strategy.\n",
            "To use the \"Trapping Pairs\" strategy, you need to wait for a certain setup on the board. Your first checker (piece 1) should be in the leftmost or rightmost column, against the edge of the board. Your second checker (piece 2) should be one row in front of your first checker on the diagonal. Following that same diagonal, there should be an empty space, then one of your opponent's checkers(piece A), then another opponent checker (piece B) one row behind.[9]Move piece 2 toward your opponent's pieces, so that it is in danger of being captured.The forced capture rule requires your opponent's piece A to jump piece 2, but it cannot then jump piece 1 because it is against the edge of the board.After your opponent has captured your piece 2, the you can use your piece 1 to jump piece A.In the basic scenario described, this is an unexciting 1-for-1 trade. However, after setting up your trapping pair, you can often wait to \"trigger\" it until the opportunity for a double capture arises.\n",
            "Use the \"Redirect Your Enemy\" strategy.\n",
            "To use \"Redirect Your Enemy,\" you will need to designate 6 pieces on one side of your board as group A and the other 6 on the other side as group B. You will use these designations to determine what pieces you move at different times in the game.[10]Move the pieces in A group almost exclusively at the start of the game, only occasionally moving a B piece when there is no good A move.When you begin trading pieces with your opponent, trade A pieces over B pieces whenever possible.Once a few capture exchanges have happened, your opponent will likely be concentrated on the side of the board with your A pieces. Begin advancing your B pieces in groups and you'll be in a strong position to crown past your opponent's depleted defenses.\n",
            "Decide which rules of checkers to follow.\n",
            "Some tournaments are run using basic checkers rules, referred to as Go As You Please, GAYP, or freestyle. Others follow the 3-move rules, which limit players' options at the start of the game to a set of three move sequences. (The 3-move rules greatly reduce the possibility of a draw between skilled players.)\n",
            "Study a checkers strategy guide that matches your rules system and skill level.\n",
            "More recent books will contain up-to-date strategic advances, but this is less important if you're a beginner. Browsing the checkers shelf at a library or bookstore can help you find a book that is helpful and fun to read.\n",
            "Practice and memorize specific opening sequences.\n",
            "For 3-move play, find an encyclopedia of 3-move openers. For GAYP rules, select a preferred opener and practice games with every possible response from your opponent.[11]Memorizing specific board states from the mid-game and endgame can be useful as well, but you're much less likely to encounter a specific midgame in a tournament than one of the standard openers.\n",
            "Play against the best opponents you can find.\n",
            "Playing against more experienced players who are willing to share their knowledge is a great way to improve your game. Whether that means entering tournaments or finding your local amateur expert, the better your opponents are, the more you'll learn.[12]\n",

            "Give yourself as much time as possible.\n",
            "With every day that passes between the last time you used drugs and the date of the test, your chances of passing go up since each test is only effective for a limited time after drug use.[1] If the drug test is administered by your employer, you'll likely get warning in advance of the test. If you're being tested because you're on probation, your tests are likely to be on a set schedule. Here are the average amounts of time a drug stays in your system enough to trigger a positive drug test:[2]Marijuana: 1-7 daysCrack (Cocaine): 2-3 daysHeroin (Opiates) or Methadone: 1-3 daysSpeed/Uppers (Amphetamine, meth): 2-3 daysAngel Dust/PCP: 7-14 daysEcstacy: 2-4 daysBenzodiazepine: 1-4 daysBarbiturates: 1-3 weeksTricyclic Antidepressants: 2-7 daysOxycodone: 1-2 days\n",
            "Find out what type of test you'll be taking.\n",
            "There are four types of drug tests: urine tests, blood tests, saliva tests and hair tests. The standard 5-panel test tests for amphetamines (speed, meth, crank, ecstasy), cannabinoids (marijuana, hash), cocaine (coke, crack), opiates (heroin, morphine, opium, codeine), and phencyclidine (PCP).[3] Advancements in testing technology have made it difficult to fake tests, but knowing the differences between the tests can be helpful when it comes to your specific situation. Here's the breakdown:Urine tests are the most common type of tests administered by employers. They're the easiest tests to tamper with, since you have a small window of privacy during which you're supposed to provide a urine sample (provided you aren't being watched).Blood tests might be administered if you get pulled over and drug intoxication is suspected. This type of test is very difficult to pass if you recently used drugs, since it's effective at determining exactly how much is in your system. But if it's been several days since you've used, the test is more likely to come up negative than a urine test.[4]Saliva tests are sometimes administered in place of either urine or blood tests since they're less invasive. They are a little less sensitive than blood tests.Hair tests are extremely difficult to fake. Up to 120 strands of hair are evaluated in a laboratory to determine whether they contain traces of drugs. Since it takes up to 2 weeks for a section of hair long enough to test to grow in, a hair test can't tell whether you used drugs in the past 2 weeks. However, traces of drugs can stay in your hair for up to 90 days, so it's an effective way to determine if you're a regular user.\n",
            "Try to figure out how much of the drug is in your system.\n",
            "Depending on how much you used and when, you might be able to pass a drug test the same day or the next day. The method you'll choose to pass a drug test depends in part on how much of the drug you think is still in your system. For instance, if you're just a casual user of marijuana, the drug might not be detectable after a few days. However, heavy use of marijuana, cocaine use, certain barbiturates, and other drugs are detectable even after 15 to 30 days.[5]If you're a heavy, or \"chronic\" user of marijuana, the test you take will almost definitely read as positive. However, if you've only used it a few times, you have a decent chance of being able to flush your system and get a test that reads negative.Remember that if you're subjected to a hair test, anything you've used in the past 90 days (with the exception of the most recent two weeks) will show up.You might be able to pass a same-day drug test if you took the drug no more than 2 hours before the test (with the exception of pot and oxycodone, which will signal a positive test within 1 hour of use).[6] Still, your best bet is to hold off on using drugs entirely until youve taken the test.\n",
            "Know which test to choose if you get a choice.\n",
            "You won't always get to choose how you'll be tested for drugs, but sometimes you can decide whether you want to take a urine, blood, saliva or hair test. Instead of trying to tamper with a test, your better bet might be to choose the test that's least likely to show up as positive for you. Of course, there's no guarantee that the test will be negative, but it's worth knowing which one will give you the best chance of passing.If you've only used the drug a few times, and it was at least a week ago, your best bet is probably going to be a blood or saliva test, since most drugs leave your bloodstream after just a few hours or days.[7]If you're currently high when you take the test, you probably want to opt for a urine test, because it's less sensitive than a blood test to exact levels of drugs in your system. Urine tests don't measure THC levels, so if marijuana is the issue, even if you fail the test there won't be proof that you were impaired at the time you took it.If you tried drugs for the first time in the last week or so, and you get the option to do a hair test instead of another one, that might be your best bet. Anything you did in the last few weeks won't show up, but drugs you used stretching back 90 days will.If you're a heavy user, try not to take a hair test, since it can pick up drugs in your system from months to years back, and its very hard to dispute.[8]\n",
            "Drink a lot of water\n",
            "starting the day before the test. By increasing your intake of liquids, you will be able to (somewhat) dilute the test sample if youve used marijuana or cocaine.[9] This won't work very well if you're a heavy user, but it could do the trick if you've only used a few times.There's no special drink or ingredient that will help to \"flush\" your system or cleanse you any better than water does.[10] There is no evidence that substances like goldenseal, vinegar, niacin, or vitamin C have any effect on your levels of drug metabolites.[11]Take some vitamin B pills the day before your test to make your urine look yellow. If it's too clear, test evaluators will be suspicious.\n",
            "Urinate as much as possible before the test.\n",
            "This will help pump drug metabolites from your body. Drink a lot of water the morning of the test and make an extra effort to pee a lot before you take it.Boost your fluid output with some sort of diuretic. This will stimulate urination and will help flush your system. Diuretics include coffee, tea, and cranberry juice. Stronger diuretics, such as furosemide, are available by prescription only.Drug metabolites build up in your body while you're sleeping, so your first stream of the day will have a higher concentration. Make sure you urinate before you have to take the sample, and drink plenty of water so your urine will be more diluted.If you aren't being watched, make sure to pee in the toilet first and then in the sample cup; your initial urine stream will contain more metabolites.\n",
            "Don't try to mask or dilute the sample.\n",
            "Urine analyzers have seen it all and know to test for commercially available test-masking chemicals. Most household substances, such as bleach, salt or vinegar, will radically alter the pH of your urine, which will make it obvious that you have tampered with the sample.[12] Diluting the sample by adding water can also raise red flags by changing the color and/or temperature of your urine; a clear sample will probably be rejected offhand, as will a lukewarm one.Ignore the rumor going around that drinking bleach will purify your urine. Drinking bleach can corrode your mouth, throat, and stomach, potentially killing you. What's more, it won't even mask your sample.Don't fall for false advertising on products that say your test will come up negative if you add the substance to your urine. They don't work.\n",
            "Consider substituting synthetic or clean urine for your own.\n",
            "This is a lot trickier than it sounds, so consider it a last-ditch attempt (and one for which you'll likely be penalized if you get caught). You can either buy fake urine or find a clean donor.[13] The trick will be to maintain the sample at the proper temperature for the urinalysis (around 91 to 97 F) and smuggle it into the testing area. Kits containing both fake urine and the equipment needed to keep it at the right temperature can be purchased online or in smoke shops.Synthetic urine passes most tests, but some states have started testing for uric acid. Make sure your sample has uric acid listed as an ingredient.The synthetic urine should also have a smell. Scentless urine is suspicious to test evaluators.It's essential to keep the sample at the right temperature. If the temperature is too cold or hot, it's a dead giveaway that the sample has been tampered with.Using a donor is more risky than using fake urine, because you never know what else might show up in that person's test. You can test it yourself using a test strip available at smoke shops and most drugstores. Use the sample within 48 hours, after which it gets dark in color and the pH level begins to change.\n",
            "Try to delay a blood or saliva test.\n",
            "If there's any way you can delay taking the test, you'll have a much better shot at passing it. Most drugs are no longer traceable through a blood or saliva test after just a few hours, though some will remain in your bloodstream for up to 3 days or longer.[14] Regardless of what type of drugs you took, your chances will be better if you can delay things for a day or more.If you can't delay a saliva test, you might be able to increase your chances of passing. If you are self-administering the cheek swab for a saliva test, which is supposed to be rubbed between your lower cheek and gum, rub the swab against your teeth instead. Then, rather than hold it between your cheek and gums for two minutes as directed, bite it between your molars. This probably won't work, but it's worth a try if you're on the spot.There's really no way to manipulate the sample for a blood test, since the test is not self-administered. Blood is drawn on the spot and immediately taken to be tested.\n",
            "Shave your head\n",
            "and body before a hair test. Since your hair is cut on the spot during a hair test (rather than submitted by you), there's nothing you can really do to tamper with a hair test. However, if you don't have any hair to clip, you might be able to ask for a different type of test that will be easier to pass. If the people drug-testing you have never met you in person and you haven't already agreed to submit a hair sample, shave your head and the rest of your body (especially areas with longer hair) and casually inform them that you don't have any hair to submit. Then ask for a different test.Be sure you have a good story ready as to why your head is shaved. You could say your hair is thinning, or you're experimenting with a new style. Avoid inventing a serious medical condition (eg. cancer) to explain away your hairdo: this might create a lot of long-term complications.Since the hair sample only needs to be an inch long, be forewarned that they might ask for a sample from your leg, underarm, etc. This might be a good time to get an all-over wax and pretend to be a swimmer.\n",
            "Find a way to get out of taking it entirely.\n",
            "Since blood, saliva and hair tests are so very difficult to cheat, you might want to push the issue and see if you can get out of taking it. Here are a few ways to do it:Ask for a urine test. If you think you could pass a urine test because your urine is diluted, or you don't want a blood test because it will show exactly how high you are at the time of the test, see if you can get a urine test instead. Say you consider it less invasive than the other methods.Exercise your rights. In some cases, the person administering the test might not have the right to test you. Get to know drug laws in your state and read up on your employer's drug testing policies. See if there's a loophole that can get you out of taking this test, or delay it to a later time.\n",
            "Look into your state's laws on drug testing policies.\n",
            "Each state has different policies when it comes to drug testing. There are laws dictating how both new applicants and current employees can be tested.[15] In most cases, the employer is legally allowed to administer drug tests, but only if it gives proper notice and has the test administered by a state-run laboratory. Other common requirements include the following:All employees or applicants must be tested the same way.If an applicant is applying for a job, the fact that a drug test is part of the process must be clear from the start.In many cases, an employer isn't allowed to conduct random drug tests or blanket drug tests.In many cases, an employer can test an employee for drugs if the employer has reasonable suspicion that the employee is using (erratic behavior, inadequate work, etc.).\n",
            "Ask for a second test if you get the opportunity.\n",
            "None of the drug tests are 100 percent accurate all of the time.[16] Urine tests are the least accurate tests, but all of them are fallible. Use this to your advantage if you end up failing a drug test. Once you've failed, there's no harm in asking for another test; say you disagree with the results and would like to take it again.\n",
            "Consider challenging the test if you don't pass.\n",
            "While an employer who followed all of your state's laws regarding testing usually has the right to fire you if you fail a test or refuse to take one, you might be able to challenge the test if it wasn't administered properly. Review your company's policy and your state's laws to make sure they match up. If they don't you might be able to get the test thrown out, giving you an opportunity to take it again.Check up on the lab administering and analyzing the test to make sure it's run by the state.See if your employer gave you adequate notice in advance of the test.Determine whether you experienced what you believe to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy, such as being asked to urinate in full view of someone watching.\n",

            "Think about why you are afraid to fall in love or be loved.\n",
            "The first step in dealing with your issues with loving and/or being loved is to identify the fear that is holding you back. There are many different types of fear that can cause a person to fear loving someone or being loved.[1]Consider your feelings and try to figure out what your main concern is. What are you afraid might happen if you allow yourself to love or be loved?Try writing about your feelings to explore them in more depth. Writing about your fears concerning love may help you to identify the root of your fears and the act of writing may help you to work through some of your feelings as well.\n",
            "Think about your past relationships.\n",
            "One way that you can start to understand your fear regarding loving or being loved is to think back on your past relationships. Consider the problems that arose in the relationship and how you contributed to those problems.[2]What did you struggle with in the relationship? What did you fight about? If you broke up, what was the reason for the breakup? In what ways did you contribute to problems in the relationship? What thoughts caused you to respond in the ways that you did?\n",
            "Reflect on your childhood.\n",
            "Sometimes childhood experiences can contribute to our ability to love and be loved. If you had some difficult experiences as a child, you may be carrying to feelings into your adult relationships. Consider things that happened to you or around you as a child and how they might be affecting you as an adult.[3]Was there a lot of fighting in your household when you were a child? Did you feel rejected or unloved by one or more of your parents? How did these experiences make you feel?\n",
            "Consider some of the most common fears about loving and being loved.\n",
            "Many people have fears when it comes to loving and being loved. Among those fears are the fear of getting hurt, fear of hurting someone, and fear of commitment. Consider these different types of fears and try to determine if your feelings align with any of these categories.[4]Fear of Getting Hurt  If you have been hurt in previous relationships, you know how painful it is and may want to protect yourself from ever feeling that way again. As a result, you might try to prevent yourself from falling in love in order to avoid having to feel those painful emotions again.Fear of Hurting Someone  Perhaps you have hurt people in previous relationships and it made you feel guilty. As a result, you might want to avoid getting into another relationship and causing the same pain to someone else who you care about.Fear of Commitment  Maybe the idea of being committed to one person for the rest of your life is terrifying to you, so you dont allow yourself to get too attached.Fear of Loss of Identity  Some people think falling in love means that they have to give up certain parts of their identity, which can be scary and may cause some people to avoid love.\n",
            "Determine if you consider yourself worthy of being loved.\n",
            "Some people struggle to love and be loved because they believe that they are not loveable or not worthy of being loved. This belief can be the result of childhood neglect, rejection, or other experiences that caused you to feel unworthy of being loved. Consider whether or not your feel like you are worth of being loved.[5]\n",
            "Decide if you are having an existential crisis regarding love.\n",
            "Some people fear love because it makes them think about their mortality. Loving someone and being loved back can make the thought of death much scarier because you have more to lose. Some people may even avoid falling in love or being loved because of these negative, frightening feelings.[6]\n",
            "Challenge your negative thoughts.\n",
            "In addition to past relationships and childhood experiences, negative thinking may be preventing you from loving or being loved. Some people think negative thoughts about themselves or their partners that cause the relationship to suffer. Do not allow a negative thought to go through your mind without addressing and reframing it. Doing so will help you to change your mindset and stop reinforcing your fears about loving or being loved. The next time you have a negative thought, turn it into a positive one.[7]For example, if you are worried about being rejected, you might think something like, Shes way out of my league. Shes going to dump me. Or, if you feel unworthy of being loved you might think something like, You are too ugly for anyone to ever love you, so dont even try.These thoughts are damaging to your self-esteem and to your ability to love and be loved. If you are dealing with these types of negative thoughts, you will need to work to silence them and change them.The next time that you find yourself thinking a negative thought, stop yourself and change the thought. If you think to yourself, Shes way out of my league. Shes going to dump me, turn it into something more positive. Change it to something like, Shes a beautiful woman. I am excited to see where this relationship goes.\n",
            "Work to develop positive thoughts about love.\n",
            "You might also benefit from some positive self-talk regarding love. Try using positive daily affirmations to develop more positive feelings about love. Positive daily affirmations can help you to deal with the negative emotions that may be part of your fears about love. Take a few moments each day to look at yourself in the mirror and say something positive about love. You can say something that you believe about love or something that you would like to believe about love.[8] Some examples of things you might tell yourself include:I am worthy of love.I will have a fulfilling loving relationship someday.Love is a wonderful thing.\n",
            "Allow yourself to be vulnerable.\n",
            "Vulnerability is defined as the risk and uncertainty that comes along with emotional exposure. People who fear loving and being loved often have their defenses up in a relationship. If you want to overcome your fear of loving and being loved, you will need to lower your defenses and allow yourself to be vulnerable to your partner. This might sound frightening, but it is an important step to become more comfortable with love. Common defenses against feeling vulnerable include retreating into a fantasy world or presenting yourself in a less than ideal way.[9]Identify the defenses that you use to prevent yourself from feeling vulnerable. What are your defenses? How can you lower them and begin to allow yourself to be more vulnerable?In your next relationship, try taking the long view  using memories of past happiness as insurance for the future or recalling the original commitment and promises made to each other.\n",
            "Discuss your fears with your partner or a trusted friend.\n",
            "Talking to someone about your fears and feelings may help you to deal with your fears about loving and being loved. If you are in a relationship consider sharing these feelings with your partner. Telling your partner how you feel can open up the possibilities for greater intimacy in your relationship. Make sure that you have this discussion with your partner when you are both calm, not after or during an argument.[10]If you are not in a relationship or if you are not ready to talk to your partner about your feelings, talk to a trusted friend instead.Try starting by saying something like, I think my past/current relationship problems were caused by some of my fears about love. I am trying to work through those feelings so that the problems do not continue. Would you be willing to discuss that with me?\n",
            "Consider talking to a counselor if your problems continue.\n",
            "Sometimes fears related to loving and being love are so severe that you need to get help from a counselor. If your problems continue despite your attempts to make thing better, consider talking to a counselor about these issues. A counselor can help you to get to the root of the problems and deal with them so that you can have healthier relationships in the future.\n",

            "Make sure the body is face up.\n",
            "[1] If the body is front-side down, gravity will pull the blood down to the lowest parts of the body, particularly the face. This can discolor and bloat the facial features, making it more difficult to create a life-like appearance for the viewing.[2]\n",
            "Remove any clothing that the person is wearing.\n",
            "You will need to see the skin for signs that embalming is working, so the body will remain uncovered throughout the procedure. Also remove any IV needles or catheters that are in place.[3]Typically, you'll need to catalog any property found on the person, as well as any cuts, bruises, or other discolorations at this time on your embalming report. This will also be used to document the procedure and chemicals used in the process. The report acts as insurance if the family chooses to sue the funeral home for any reason.Respect the body at all times. Use a sheet or towel to cover the genitals, and don't leave tools laying around on it while you're working. Assume the family may pop in at any moment.\n",
            "Disinfect the mouth, eyes, nose, and other body openings.\n",
            "Wash the entire body with a germicidal soap or detergent.[4] Spray a powerful disinfectant to clean bodily openings, open wounds, and other necessary surfaces.[5]Inspect the deceased in regards to the type of fluid you will need. Some embalmers will use this opportunity to mix all the fluid they'll need for the procedure to get it ready. Usually, 16 ounces of fluid with 2 gallons (7.6L) of water is a good dilution.\n",
            "Shave the body.\n",
            "Typically, the face and body are shaved at this point.[6] Men, women, and children are shaved to improve the look of the makeup. However, if the person had facial hair, the hair stays.[7]\n",
            "Relieve rigor mortis by massaging the body.\n",
            "Massage the major muscle groups to relieve the tension and move stiff joints to loosen them up. Even though rigor mortis goes away naturally, massaging the body helps to postpone it or move the process along.[8]\n",
            "Close the eyes.\n",
            "Use great care in setting the eyes. Place an eye cap on each eye to set the eyelids in place.[9]Eyelids are never sewn shut but may be glued shut in some cases.The features need to be set before the embalming fluid is introduced, because that fluid will \"set\" the body fairly rigidly, making it difficult to do it afterward.\n",
            "Close the mouth and set it naturally.\n",
            "One of two methods is typically used to set the mouth:[10]Sometimes, the mouth is sewn shut using mandible suture. Pass a curved needle through the jaw under the gums and back up through the septum. Place dentures, a mouth former, or cotton inside to help shape the mouth. Tie the string into a bow.[11]A needle injector is also commonly used in conjunction with a mouth form. Like a mouthguard or a dental prosthetic, the mouth form holds the jaw together to create a natural bite and alignment of the jaw.[12] This method often includes less room for human error.\n",
            "Moisturize the features.\n",
            "Apply a small amount of massage cream to the face and hands to keep the skin soft and pliable.\n",
            "Find the carotid or femoral artery.\n",
            "The arteries are embalmed by simultaneously introducing embalming fluid (a mixture of formaldehyde, other chemicals, and water) into the carotid or femoral artery while draining the blood from a nearby vein or from the heart. It takes about two gallons of fluid to embalm a typical body.[13]\n",
            "Make your incision.\n",
            "Clean the vein point off, create an entrance point, and insert the drain tube towards the heart. Tie a ligature around the lower side of the tube.[14]Do the same for the artery except insert the cannula instead of a drain tube. Place the cannula forceps on the artery locking the cannula in place. Use the small locking forceps to clamp off the upper side of the artery and restrict the flow.\n",
            "Turn on your embalming machine and distribute the fluid.\n",
            "While the embalming is taking place, wash the body with a good germicidal or antibacterial soap and be sure to check for drainage while massaging the limbs to push blood out and embalming solution in.[15]When the fluid enters the arteries, pressure will build throughout the veins, which means the fluid is moving throughout the body. You'll notice the veins bulging somewhat. Open the jugular drain tube periodically to allow blood to escape and relieve the pressure.\n",
            "Slowly decrease the pressure.\n",
            "Once the area is thoroughly embalmed, turn off the machine and reverse your arterial tube to the other side of the artery you chose to inject.[16] This will embalm the part that was blocked by the arterial tube previously. Be sure to turn down the pressure, as the fluid only has to go a short distance.In the case of the femoral, this will embalm the lower leg. In the case of the right common carotid, this will embalm the right side of the head.\n",
            "Finish.\n",
            "When you've embalmed to your satisfaction, or run out of fluid, turn off the machine, remove the cannula, and tie off the veins and arteries you used. Suture the incisions closed. Use sealing powder or putty to ensure there is no leakage.[17]\n",
            "Use a trocar to aspirate the organs.\n",
            "Now that the arteries have been embalmed, you need to suction any liquids or gasses inside the organs in a process called aspiration.[18]\n",
            "Aspirate the chest cavity.\n",
            "Insert the trocar 2 inches (5.1cm) to the right and 2 inches (5.1cm) superior to the umbilicus (belly button).[19] Clean out the hollow organs in the abdomen such as the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine.\n",
            "Aspirate the lower cavity.\n",
            "Remove the trocar, turn it around, and insert it into the lower body, aspirating the contents of the large intestine, bladder, and in the case of females, the uterus. The anus and vagina are sometimes packed with cotton to avoid seepage.\n",
            "Inject cavity fluid into the torso.\n",
            "Attach a 16 ounce bottle of cavity fluid to the other end of the bottle injector. The gravity injection method is typically used to push the cavity fluid into the hollow organs, sterilizing and preserving them.[20]Make sure you get both the upper and lower organs. This step is crucial in preventing \"purge.\"\n",
            "Remove the trocar and close the hole with a trocar screw.\n",
            "[21] Clean out your trocar and put it away.\n",
            "Wash the body thoroughly.\n",
            "Using the same disinfectant used earlier, clean the body thoroughly to remove any blood or other chemicals left behind by the embalming process.[22] Use delicacy and care in this process.\n",

            "Learn about tactics.\n",
            "Tactics refer to move sequences that are designed to achieve specific advantage and capture or defend pieces. Tactics are different than strategy in that the latter refers to longer-term piece development with an endgame in mind. Learn how to identify opportunities to utilize tactics and how to execute them.Forks, also known as double attacks, involve positioning a piece so that two different opposing pieces are under attack at once and unable to counter-attack your piece. Any piece can fork but the knight is particularly useful for forking because it is the only piece that can attack while wedged between horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lanes.[1]Discovered attacks involve using one offensive piece to cover another. For example, if a queen has a diagonal line on a rook but is covered by your knight, you can move the knight out of the way and create an attack opportunity for your queen. Your opponent may not pay attention to a covered piece and thus put their key pieces at risk. [2]Pinning involves placing one piece on a line of attack against the king with another opposing piece in the way. The opposing piece cannot move without exposing the king and must be sacrificed. For example, by placing a bishop diagonal to a king with a knight in the way, your opponent will be forced to sacrifice the knight.[3]\n",
            "Develop your knowledge of strategies.\n",
            "Once you reach advanced-level play, you will need to start each match with a core strategy in mind. Core strategies concern general attempts to control portions of the board that will set you up for effective endgame tactics later on. You should also learn about more specific strategies like the Nimzo Defense and the Sicilian Defense which will provide more precise directions for how to move early on in the match. Even if you dont use these precise strategies, you should learn about them so you can recognize their use by your opponents.[4]Spacing strategies refer to attempts to obtain the largest amount of board coverage to limit your opponents maneuvering options. Spacing is not about pushing individual pieces as far forward as possible but about slowly moving several offensive pieces into your opponents territory advancing pawns for defense and support.A lot of core strategies focus on controlling the center. The center refers to the four spaces in the middle of the board (D4, E4, D5, and E5). Specifically, these strategies focus on moving pawns toward the center spaces with offensive pieces supporting them.[5]If you find yourself in a defensive position, exchange pieces to open up more space. Exchanging refers to sacrificing and then trading pieces of equal value.[6]\n",
            "Execute endgame situations.\n",
            "The endgame is the final stage of the match when there are very few pieces on the board. Endgame situations are distinct from the strategies you would use early on or in the middle because there is so much more space to move. A strong game-long strategy that gives you an advantage can be undone if you dont know how to protect yourself from clever endgame flanking maneuvers.Pawns become particularly important in the endgame stage as they can be promoted by reaching the backline. Its often advantageous to maintain stalemates with your offensive pieces until you can promote your pawns.[7]While its best to reserve your king near the backline during most of the game, as the board opens up, youll want to move it closer toward the middle to give it more maneuverability to get out of checks and support other pieces. The kings ability to move in all 8 directions makes it much more valuable as an offensive piece as board opens up.[8]\n",

            "Look up your preferred flight online to see if there are seats available.\n",
            "Go to the Southwest online booking page and search for the new flight you want to be on. Then, see if it's sold out or if there are still seats available. If your destination city has multiple airports, be flexible and search for alternative Southwest flights going into each one.Note that this isn't a fool-proof method of checking for standby seats. It's not uncommon for airlines to overbook flights, so even if it doesn't say \"sold out,\" there could still be a chance that it is.\n",
            "Call the airlines to ask about any available seats before you go to the airport.\n",
            "Ask if your preferred standby flight is already full or if there's a good chance you'll get a seat. Sometimes people change or cancel their reservations last minute. Or, if there is inclement weather in certain areas of the country, cancelled connections or delayed flights might mean that a seat could open up on connecting flights.[1]Note that all standby passengers need to already have a confirmed ticket. Flyers with companion passes do not get the same benefits as the original (top tier) ticket holder theyre traveling with, which means theyre not eligible for standby.For instance, say you want to fly from Denver to Los Angeles. If another traveler is flying from Chicago to Los Angeles with a layover in Denver, they might miss their connection in Denver due to winter weather delays in Chicago, opening up a seat on the flight you want.\n",
            "Choose non-peak travel times and seasons to increase your chances.\n",
            "Avoid trying to fly standby during the busiest hours and seasons. Holidays and big events make it less likely that there will be no-shows. Instead, search for early morning (before 7:00 AM) or late night (after 10:00 PM) flights (ones people are more likely to miss or reschedule) to increase your chances of getting a seat.If theres a big event in your destination city around the time you plan to arrive (like a big music festival or sporting event), you may have less of a chance of getting a seat.Trying to get a standby ticket around major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas is going be very difficult.Tuesdays and Wednesdays tend to be the least busy (and cheapest) days to fly, while Mondays and Fridays tend to be the busiest.[2]You can still try to fly standby during peak times and seasons, but the odds wont be in your favor.\n",
            "Go to the airport 1 to 2 hours before the standby flights boarding time.\n",
            "If you've found an earlier flight that you want to try to get on, arrive at the airport at least 1 hour before that flight starts boarding. If you're traveling internationally or from a major hub (like Houston or New York) try to get there 2 hours before boarding time.Check for delays before you go at https://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/usmap.jsp.\n",
            "Talk to a customer service agent about putting you on the standby list.\n",
            "Go to the airport and visit a customer service agent at the Southwest ticketing counter. Let them know which flight you'd like to be on and have your current confirmation information handy to streamline the process. You cannot request standby online, over the phone, or at a check-in kiosk.[3]If you're already past security, you can talk to an agent at the gate of your current flight (or at the gate of the earlier flight you want to be on).\n",
            "Pay the fee or difference in ticket price, if required.\n",
            "If you purchased one of the cheaper ticket options like Wanna Get Away or Senior for your original flight, youll need to pay the difference in price for the two flights. \"Anytime\" and \"Business Select\" fares don't require you to pay the difference in fees.[4]The fee is typically around $75 but it may be more or less depending on the price difference between the two flights. Youll only pay this fee if youve been issued a ticket on your new standby flight.You're more likely to get the extra seat if you frequently fly with Southwest (and have elite status) or if you purchased a more expensive Anytime or Business Select fare.\n",
            "Go to the departure gate and wait for standby procedures.\n",
            "Ticketed passengers will board the plane first, so you'll have to wait for each boarding group to go before they start ticketing standby passengers. Once the agent calls for standby passengers, you'll need to listen for your name to be called or watch the screen to see if your name is cleared on the standby list.Be patient; don't ask the gate agent about where you stand every 5 minutes!Download the Southwest mobile app and sign in with your reservation number or rapid rewards number in order to view the standby list from your phone.\n",

            "Understand quitclaim deeds.\n",
            "A quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers an interest in property from one party to another. It lists who is transferring their interest in the property (the grantor) and who is receiving it (the grantee).[1] Individuals often use a quitclaim when they want to do the following:[2]transfer property into or out of a revocable trusttransfer property to a spouse as part of a divorcetransfer interest as a co-owner to the other co-ownertransfer property you own by yourself into co-ownership with anotherchange the way you hold title to the property\n",
            "Pull a copy of your current deed.\n",
            "If you have to fill out the quitclaim deed, then you should get a copy of the current deed to the property. You will need the legal description of property, which is on the current deed. See Get a Legal Description of Property for more information.You might also have to go to the county clerks office to get the copy of the deed. Ask the person working there how to get a copy.\n",
            "Decide if a warranty deed is more appropriate.\n",
            "With a warranty deed, the seller warrants that the land is free of all liens. If the seller is wrong, then the real estate buyer can sue for compensation. With a quitclaim deed, the grantee has no recourse if someone with a lien shows up.[3]Accordingly, a warranty deed is probably more appropriate if you are transferring the property outside of the family.[4]If you need to talk to someone, then try to find a lawyer you can meet with for a short consultation. A qualified lawyer will listen to the facts of your case and advise you about whether a quitclaim deed is appropriate.\n",
            "Get the form.\n",
            "The county clerk should have a form for you to pick up or download. The quitclaim form for Brevard County is available for download.Stop by the clerks office and ask if a form is available.\n",
            "Complete the form.\n",
            "The form will ask for a variety of information. Type or print neatly in black ink and provide all information requested. You will probably need to provide the following:[5]Name and address of the person who created the quitclaim deedParcel Identification number to the propertyName and address of the grantor (the person transferring the property)Name and address of the grantee (the person receiving the property)The amount paid in consideration of the deedThe legal description of the property\n",
            "Have the form witnessed.\n",
            "You will need to have at least two witnesses for each signature on the deed. If two co-owners are transferring their interest, then you will need four total witnesses.All individuals should sign the deed in front of a notary. There is probably a notary at the clerks office. You can also find a notary in most large banks.\n",
            "File the form.\n",

            "Pay the fee.\n",
            "The fee to record the deed is $10 for the first page and $8.50 for each additional page.[6]You also must pay taxes. A documentary stamp tax of $.70 will be levied for each $100 of the sale, transfer, or consideration amount. If the consideration was $100,000, then you would have to pay $700.Miami-Dade County has a different tax schedule. A documentary stamp tax of $.60 per each $100 is assessed.

            "Be a good example for other youth.\n",
            "As a Christian youth, you should lead by example. That means following Christian teachings. Everything you do in your life should reflect the goodness of God.[1]Show positivity, smile, and do good works.[2] Dont talk behind other peoples backs. Be kind to all people, including those who arent popular. Love thy neighbor as thyself.  Walk the walk, dont just talk the talk.Be a leader. Dont participate or laugh at sinful subjects. Just walk away. But also try to get people to stop doing it. If you see bullying occurring, intervene. Be the one person at your school that doesn't tolerate cussing or gossip.Dont drink, smoke, party, cheat on tests, gossip, or engage in other negative behaviors.  Be someone who spends Friday night on their knees in prayer rather than at a party getting wasted.\n",
            "Be patient and kind.\n",
            "If people can't tell you're a Christian by your actions and words, you're doing it wrong. You need to live every single day with the right attitude.Love others and be willing to help them even at cost to yourself.[3] This is a fundamental commandment that Jesus gave during his time on Earth. To love others as you love yourself is so important. Dont let ego and status stop you from treating others as you would your own brothers and sisters.Don't be close minded. Love all people of all religions, races, sexual orientations, and beliefs. Don't swear or speak about inappropriate things, or make intolerant statements. You can't make a positive difference if you are cursing or making dirty jokes. Be respectful, honorable, and pure.Set an example of Christianity every day at work or school, or both. Be humble, kind, patient, and respectful when engaging with non-Christians.\n",
            "Reach out to people who are shunned by others.\n",
            "Jesus showed love to people who were treated negatively by others or regarded lowly by society. Never give up on someone, and especially never give up on God, in the good times and the bad.You will encounter islands in school and other settings. This means there are people who only hang out with certain people because they don't know anyone else and won't make an effort to know anyone else. It is something everyone does. You need to step up and be a bridge, which means stepping out of your comfort zone.You can sit with someone who sits alone at lunch and just be a friend. Or you could lend a listening ear to them. Building a personal relationship is a great first step to leading someone to Christ. A subtle but effective way to spread faith is to plant seeds and allow the Holy Spirit to take root within others.You have the relationships with the people around you already, and you can be the one who encourages them, offers prayers, and lives out the Bible so as to be an example of God's love and grace. Treat everyone as an equal. Whatever their status in life or profession, remember that all people are God's creation and deserve a chance to be understood.\n",
            "Be able to take rejection or loss with grace.\n",
            "You should be happy to do the good deeds you do. However, it can be more challenging to show a positive attitude when you are rejected or otherwise face negativity in your life.When confronted about your beliefs, don't freak out. Remember that everyone has a different story as to how they became a Christian, whether it was a dramatic conversion or they just grew up in it, but no matter how you became a Christian, it's your firsthand account. Tell people why you believe what you believe even if they ridicule you for it.[4]Turn the other cheek. If someone is rude to you or cruel, show them forgiveness and love. Forgiveness is a Christian trait. We are all born sinners, and we all struggle and we all fall at times. Dont let that discourage you. If someones hurt you, find a way to forgive.When you fall, forgive yourself too, and pick yourself back up and try again. What matters to God is how many times you stand up. Strive to grow in a positive way. You are unique, you have your own gifts, talents, strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes. Grow the positive aspects of your personality.\n",
            "Keep studying your faith.\n",
            "Continue to study and learn about your faith as you get older. Know that even adults still work on the tough questions.Come to youth group with a heart that wants to learn. People will notice a change in your group. Start answering questions and step out of your comfort zone. Once you step out of your comfort zone, others will start to step out of theirs.[5]Spouting verse is all well and good, but understanding the deeper meaning behind it all, how it fits into the entire narrative of the Bible, is more important. You can say \"God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son...\" (John 3:16), but until you can show that same love to others, it's difficult for others to see the positive change caused by your faith.\n",
            "Read the Bible.\n",
            "You could try to read a scripture a day. Gods word is vital to a Christian life because it provides guidelines.  You could also listen to podcasts or watch YouTube videos on your faith.Ask questions. You wont know everything. There are many Christians who have studied faith for their whole lives, but they still dont know everything. Keep in mind that historical context, language, translation, context or meaning can matter when reading Christian teachings.Seek out older religious teachers and show them great respect, such as a pastor or priest or a Sunday school teacher. Ask them to help you learn more about your faith. Make sure that you keep involved in a Bible study, preferably involving kids your age. This is much more effective in helping you learn and relate to the Bible than attending only traditional worship services.\n",
            "Pray\n",
            "as often as you can and go to church. You can simply start off by saying, God, I do not know what to do, but I have this desire in my heart to make a difference. God doesnt care what you say to Him. He just loves to listen to you.[6]You could start a prayer journal so that you can remember what you prayed for and then see how God has answered your prayers.  Dont forget to pray for others too, not just for yourself.You should attend church as much as you can and ask your parents if they can drive you. Try memorizing some important prayers and saying them before you go to bed and every meal. Just take time out of your day to relax and think about God, what are you thankful for and what you did wrong and could improve.Ask God what to do through prayer. God knows all your abilities, strengths, and weaknesses and he knows whats right for you to do to make a difference. Don't let your age or comfort zones get in the way of doing what God calls you to do.\n",
            "Lead a fundraiser to help someone in need.\n",
            "Maybe you start out by collecting spare change or donating your allowance. Find a worthy cause, and help collect donations for it. Or just give whatever money you have to a good cause.[7]You could use an online donation site. You can also help by joining or helping a cause that revolves around helping people know about God and His Word; there are many organizations that cater to the needs of less fortunate people all across the world as well as teach them about Christ.Perhaps you do car washes or lemonade stands. Sell your old books. Its not necessarily how much you donate that counts. Its the fact youre giving most or all of what you have that matters.\n",
            "Join a youth group or mission.\n",
            "This is another way that you can give back: By getting involved with group activities associated with your church. Try to get involved in your local church's mission trips, whether they are around the world, national, or local. If your church does not have these types of trips, you could bring the idea to the congregation.[8]Try tithing (giving 10% of your money to your church), or donating some of the stuff you don't use anymore. Inviting your friends to church or youth group are great ideas too.Dont treat youth group like school, and dont act like it bores you. Dedicate yourself to God, and show this by always staying happy and cheerful and giving what you can to the group. You could also start/join a Christian club at your school (if it's allowed)Remember that a mission doesn't have to be across an ocean. You could go on a mission trip to a local college or high school and help out staff with some church friends and talk about Jesus to anyone willing to listen.\n",
            "Be open about your faith and principles.\n",
            "At times, this might be very difficult. You might feel like the only Christian youth around who is open about faith. Stand your ground. Actively develop your relationship with Christ. Get out and interact with people and develop relationships.Christian youth are ambassadors, not secret agents. In order to change people's hearts, you first need to interact with them. Be as outward as possible about your faith. You could wear shirts that spark conversations.Stand up for and voice your moral beliefs. You can do this in a way that sounds positive, not negative. Be willing to stand up for what you believe in. Be a witness  to what God has done for you as a Christian. A lot of young people have some, little, or absolutely no faith in God whatsoever. By being walking proof about what the word has to offer, you are making a difference somewhere.\n",
            "Give back by volunteering your time.\n",
            "You could help the homeless, take care of an elderly or disabled person, or work at an animal shelter. Help at your church, school, and in your home too.You can also give back in smaller ways by simply being a positive force in your environment. Help classmates with schoolwork out of class, for example. You can organize park cleanups or volunteer for blood drives.Help yourchurch. Basically just volunteer to help your church. It could be something as simple as holding the door for people visiting your church. You could offer to clean up after the services.\n",
            "Share your faith if you think it will help others.\n",
            "This doesnt mean that you try to push your beliefs on others. However, if someone asks you about what keeps you strong in all you do, gently tell them you believe in God, and you put all your worries/fears/pain onto God so that you can help others with theirs.Also don't be afraid to share your testimony- talk to your youth minister/pastor about opportunities to share your story, and where you can help within the church. The important thing to remember is that simply letting people know you are a Christian can sometimes be enough as long as you are happy and friendly and don't force anything down anyone's throat.Its a good idea to let more people know that God has their back if you perceive that a person is struggling and receptive to the message. However, understand that being a Christian is not about beating out other religions. Christianity is a peaceful and loving religion. Learn to love the people around you for who they are and that you cannot change them by shoving a Bible down their throat. If you want to show how Christianity has made you a better person, be kind to those around you regardless of their beliefs.\n",

Your chinchilla's cage should be 16 by 18 by 16 inches (41 46 41cm) at minimum.[1]A tall and wide cage is the best, but tall is better than wide if you can't get both.Chinchillas love to jump, so multiple levels are great for them. Try to get a tall cage because they can jump up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) high.Glass cages are not good for chinchillas because the glass severely limits air flow.\n",
            "Make sure the cage has a solid bottom.\n",
            "A chinchilla can get its feet caught in wire floors, which can cause serious physical harm. A solid floor can be made of hard plastic or plywood and it is helpful if the bottom piece is removable so it can be cleaned thoroughly.[2]\n",
            "Ensure that the cage bars are close together.\n",
            "It's important that the chinchilla can't stick its head through the bars. If its head fits through the bars, its whole body will fit through and it can escape. These animals have a lot of fur and small bodies underneath.If you choose a wire cage, ensure that there are no bits of wire poking out that your chinchilla could cut itself on if it does try to squeeze through the bars.\n",
            "Provide a nesting box for your chinchilla.\n",
            "A nesting box will give your chinchilla somewhere to take refuge if it is scared or tired. This box should measure at least 20 in (50 cm) in length and 10 in (25 cm) width and height, and can be made out of a chew-proof material. The nesting box should be placed on the floor, not on any shelves, because the chinchilla might knock it down.Proper nesting boxes can be purchased through pet supply retailers online and in some pet supply stores.\n",
            "Place the cage in a high, quiet area.\n",
            "It's important to keep their cage in an area where it is quiet during the day so their sleep cycle is not interrupted. Also, chinchillas do not like being looked down on. You should keep their cage on a counter top or somewhere relatively high up. If you look down on them, it can severely scare them.Chins have different psychology from cats and dogs, which are predators. They are prey animals, so they are always fearful of being attacked and eaten.Do not put a chinchilla's cage in a spot where a dog, cat, or anything else can harm or injure it.\n",
            "Keep your chinchilla cool.\n",
            "Chinchillas overheat easily, so it's ideal to keep them in a room that is between 60F (16C) and 70F (21C). They cannot survive temperatures over 80F (27C) or below 50F (10C). Also, keep their cage in a room with lots of air flow and make sure their cage is not in a spot where the sunlight can directly land on them. Any amount of direct sunlight can cause them to become overheated very quickly.[3]Do not allow them to be in high humidity, either. If you have a humid home, put them near a dehumidifier.\n",
            "Provide healthy bedding.\n",
            "Try to use kiln-dried aspen on the floor of your chinchilla's cage. You can also use Carefresh or any other paper bedding, but be aware that, when ingested, the paper will expand in the animal's system, causing possible blockage in the digestive tract.[4]Some people use fleece fabric on the bottom of their chinchilla cages. If you do this, the fabric needs to washed weekly and you need to be careful to use only fleece and not other fabrics.[5]Also, never use cedar shavings as bedding, as the phenols in the cedar are very strong and cause serious respiratory, skin, coat and liver problems. They are also poisonous to chinchillas if they try to eat them.\n",
            "Remove soiled hay and bedding from the cage daily.\n",
            "It's important to keep the bottom of the cage clean so that the animal stays clean and disease doesn't spread. Pick up soiled bedding in areas where the chinchilla goes to the bathroom as soon as you see their waste and put new, clean bedding in its place right away.[6]\n",
            "Wash the cage with hot water weekly.\n",
            "It is generally suggested that you use no soap or chemicals on the inside of your chinchilla's cage. Instead, simply use hot water to clean the cage. Swish some water around the cage's plastic pan, then clean it thoroughly with hot water and let it air dry. This is a good way to kill most of the bacteria that can harm your chinchilla.[7]Don't ever use bleach or any other chemicals on the cage that could harm your chinchilla.If you are housing more than 1 chinchilla in a cage, that cage should be cleaned more than once a week.\n",
            "Provide a constant supply of timothy hay.\n",
            "Your chinchilla should have a supply of good quality timothy hay available to them at all times. Provide it in a bowl or loose on the bottom of the chinchilla's cage.[8]You can provide timothy hay in racks and hay balls, but be aware that chinchillas are known for getting stuck in them.Providing hay gives your chinchilla necessary fiber. Chewing hay helps them avoid tooth overgrowth.\n",
            "Give your chinchilla pellets daily.\n",
            "Pellets provide your chinchilla with a variety of vitamins and nutrients. Choose a pellet that is designed for chinchilla nutrition needs and follow the instructions provided with it for portion sizing. Place the pellets in a food dish and make sure that dish is cleaned daily before the pellets are put in it.[9]Most adult chinchillas should eat around 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of pellets every day, depending on what type of pellets they are given.\n",
            "Feed chinchillas treats infrequently.\n",
            "Feeding them other snacks too frequently can cause digestive problems. Safe treats include raisins, carrots, apple, oats, dried blackberry leaves, rose petals from plants that have not been sprayed with poisons of any kind, unsweetened cheerios, unsweetened shredded wheat, dried rose hips, and safe wood chew sticks. However, these should be given in very small servings and should only be given once or twice a week.[10]Never give fruit, vegetables, nuts, or other treats that are not listed as safe.\n",
            "Replace the drinking water daily.\n",
            "Use either filtered water or chemical-free tap water and place it in a water bottle with a sipper tube on the end of it that is connected to the side of their cage. Make sure that they have water in that bottle at all times and put clean water in it every day, even if it still has water in it from the day before.Remember to sterilize the water bottle when changing the water. The algae that grows in their water can cause liver problems or severe diarrhea, or even kill a chinchilla.[11]Chinchillas cannot handle some naturally occurring bacteria or parasites in water like humans, dogs, and cats can, so you need to be sure that the water you give them is clean.\n",
            "Begin handling a chinchilla weekly from an early age.\n",
            "If they are handled from birth, they will be tame and docile. If they have no positive physical contact with people until they are full-grown, they will likely not adjust well to being handled unless they are given extensive training.[12]\n",
            "Read a chinchilla's cues to determine if they want to be handled.\n",
            "Chinchillas are usually very friendly but shouldn't be over-handled. Make sure your chinchilla does not bark as you go to pick it up. If it does, don't pick it up. This is one of their ways of telling you to back off.Chinchillas have other defenses as well, such as losing fur, biting, and spraying urine. If your chinchilla is doing any of these things, you may be handling it too much.\n",
            "Lift your chinchilla properly.\n",
            "Lift your pet like you would for a rabbit. Slide your hand under the chinchilla's belly and place your other hand on top of the chinchilla. Use the hand under the chinchilla to support its hind legs and bum so it feels secure. Don't hold the chinchilla too tightly, but do remember that they can be squirmy, so you need to hold them firmly.It is very important that you don't squeeze, especially around the upper torso. Chinchillas have what is known as a \"floating ribcage\" and you can cause severe internal injuries to it by squeezing that area.Make sure to be gentle with them to avoid scaring them.\n",
            "Give your chinchilla something to chew on for dental health.\n",
            "Chinchillas' teeth grow continuously and can grow up to 12 inches (30cm) a year. To avoid overgrowth, which can impact a chinchilla's ability to eat, purchase a special block of wood or pumice stone for your chinchilla to chew on. These are typically available at most pet supply stores.[13]Also provide your chinchilla with branches that can be climbed and gnawed on. Ensure that these branches are not cut from trees that have recently been sprayed with chemicals, or that are poisonous, such as yew, laburnum, and fresh pine.Recommended trees are sycamore and manzanita, as they provide straight wood that is quite resistant to the chinchilla's sharp teeth. Apple tree branches are another good alternative that can be found quite easily.\n",
            "Give your chinchilla dust to bathe in.\n",
            "Water can harm the chinchilla's fur, so you can't give it a bath with water. Instead, give them a dust bath. The \"dust\" bath is made with a mix of dusting powder made of volcanic ash or activated clay and is available from most pet supply businesses. Place the dust in a metal pan that is at least 6 inches (15cm) by 12 inches (30cm) and only allow the chinchilla access to it for about 10-15 minutes 2 to 3 times per week.The dust baths help the chinchilla get rid of excess grease in their fur.Do not get chinchillas wet. Their fur does not dry out like a normal animal, causing it to get damaged and moldy.Letting your chinchilla have too much time in the dust bath will cause too much dryness on the animal's coat. However, too little dust bathing will cause their coats to build up oils, which can cause a disfiguring and deadly fungus to grow on their skin.\n",
            "Provide exercise opportunities.\n",
            "Chinchillas are very active animals and should have an opportunity to exercise every day. This exercise can be a combination of running around inside their cages and giving them time to run around outside of their cage. [14]If you do let your pet out of the cage for supervised play time, it should be in a small room and the room should be chinchilla-proof, which means there are no wires, furniture, or other things for them to chew on.Keep in mind that chinchillas can jump several feet (nearly 2 meters) in the air and can squeeze through tiny spaces when you let them out of their cage.Chinchillas are nocturnal animals, so exercise time outside of the cage is best in the evening in a big area where they can run around.\n",
            "Be wary of using an exercise wheel or ball.\n",
            "Do not provide a wire exercise wheel in their cage. Using wheels like this can cause them to injure their feet. If you want to give them a wheel, make sure it has a solid surface and is large in diameter, so they don't bend their backs too far and injure them.Also, never use the giant hamster balls pet stores try to sell you. Instead, let them out in a supervised air-conditioned room, and allow your chinchillas to run freely.\n",
            "Watch out for signs of illness.\n",
            "Keep an eye on the general health of your chinchilla so that you can catch health problems early and get them treated. Assess the animal's energy level and physical health daily, looking for changes in how it moves and how much it is eating and drinking. Also look over its coat, making sure there are not areas of fur loss. If you see any of these problems, consult with your veterinarian.[15]Look at the clarity of the chinchilla's eyes and for excess drainage from the nose, which can be signs of an infection.Also look at the state of the chinchilla's feces. If the consistency changes dramatically, it may have a digestive problem occurring.\n",
